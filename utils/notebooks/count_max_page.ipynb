In short, everything and more of what you hear is true. I've had my Tesla model Y LR for a year now; driven more than 30000km in all sorts of conditions, countries and places. A quick summary: \\n+ the interior space is free of annoying buttons, and quite comfortable\\n+ the ability to control everything via the Tesla app, get in and out, preheat/cool the car and share the key with whomever \\n+ acceleration - it's now a given for all electric cars but still fun\\n+ tesla charging network, saves you a few minutes on each charge, but most companies are now adapting\\n- Autopilot is a dangerous joke - it's jerky, it tries to kill you on the highway and is in most cases \\\"out of service\\\" because one or more cameras are dirty \\n- Windshield wipers: Never in my adult life have I stepped into a car where having to fidget with the wipers has been more needed; in auto mode they'd try and swipe off the light at a traffic light, anything but what they're supposed to. It's clear whoever engineered them hasn't accounted for rain in their calculations\\n- Lights - this is where the other drivers should form some sort of union against being blinded by our tesla's, the light pattern scatters everywhere but where it's supposed to\\n- Paint - in short, there's more and better quality on my toaster. You'll see it right away but there's not much you can do about it\\n- value loss - bought the car the very last days of December, they discounted it by 40000DKK in January ; no message or offer to compensate; Should've prolly just returned it considering the 2 weeks consumer rights thing. \\n- Parking aid - just as autopilot, only trust it if you wanna spend your money fixing the car; the 3D projection is often off and doesn't account for smaller obstacles...as most of the pillars / poles or other things you find in parking lots, the only thing you can use are the cameras. \\n- gaps, it looks like a lego car when you really look into it...\\n- noise insulation is pretty much non existent, you'll be very connected to your surroundings \\n- Drive - over long distances it can be really stressful and tiring for your foot (considering you can't and SHOULD NEVER rely on autopilot - a few trips on the autobahn taught me that the hard way)\\n- \\\"I hear noises\\\" - soon enough you start walking the fine line between paranoia and schizophrenia as squeaks start forming around the car\\n- A/C - heating - as you start the system, especially the AC during summer, you'll hear something comparable to someone taking a can opener and trying to can open your hood; a metal on metal scratch that Tesla Service considers \\\"according to specs / all normal\\\" ; oh and you can't really turn off the air for your passenger, you can only redirect it...\\n\\nThe overall feeling after 1 year of ownership is that I bought into a project/prototype that will never really become anything more. \\n\\nConclusion, a gigantic \\\"DON'T BUY\\\" ! there are other options out there. More so now that it has become a symbol of ignorance and malevolence. \\n\\nP.s. if there are any Tesla competitors out there, I'd be very willing to share a detailed report of the above. They can't be selling all this \\\"smoke\\\" without consequences...\\n\",\"rating\":1,\"labels\":{\"merged\":null,\"verification\":{\"isVerified\":False,\"createdDateTime\":\"2024-11-19T14:18:09.000Z\",\"reviewSourceName\":\"Organic\",\"verificationSource\":\"invitation\",\"verificationLevel\":\"not-verified\",\"hasDachExclusion\":False}},\"title\":\"An honest review of a Tesla Model Y LR '23\",\"likes\":2,\"dates\":{\"experiencedDate\":\"2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2024-11-19T14:18:09.000Z\",\"updatedDate\":null},\"report\":null,\"hasUnhandledReports\":False,\"consumer\":{\"id\":\"5ce67a3ce518558158a98019\",\"displayName\":\"Radu Samson\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5ce67a3ce518558158a98019/73x73.png\",\"numberOfReviews\":4,\"countryCode\":\"DK\",\"hasImage\":true,\"isVerified\":true},\"reply\":null,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameDomain\":1,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameLocation\":null,\"productReviews\":[],\"language\":\"en\",\"location\":null},{\"id\":\"67092b288cfe520d0d50af44\",\"filtered\":False,\"pending\":False,\"text\":\"Following up on an order, I had to visit Tesla store at Guildford.

In short, everything and more of what you hear is true. I've had my Tesla model Y LR for a year now; driven more than 30000km in all sorts of conditions, countries and places. A quick summary: \\n+ the interior space is free of annoying buttons, and quite comfortable\\n+ the ability to control everything via the Tesla app, get in and out, preheat/cool the car and share the key with whomever \\n+ acceleration - it's now a given for all electric cars but still fun\\n+ tesla charging network, saves you a few minutes on each charge, but most companies are now adapting\\n- Autopilot is a dangerous joke - it's jerky, it tries to kill you on the highway and is in most cases \\\"out of service\\\" because one or more cameras are dirty \\n- Windshield wipers: Never in my adult life have I stepped into a car where having to fidget with the wipers has been more needed; in auto mode they'd try and swipe off the light at a traffic light, anything but what they're supposed to. It's clear whoever engineered them hasn't accounted for rain in their calculations\\n- Lights - this is where the other drivers should form some sort of union against being blinded by our tesla's, the light pattern scatters everywhere but where it's supposed to\\n- Paint - in short, there's more and better quality on my toaster. You'll see it right away but there's not much you can do about it\\n- value loss - bought the car the very last days of December, they discounted it by 40000DKK in January ; no message or offer to compensate; Should've prolly just returned it considering the 2 weeks consumer rights thing. \\n- Parking aid - just as autopilot, only trust it if you wanna spend your money fixing the car; the 3D projection is often off and doesn't account for smaller obstacles...as most of the pillars / poles or other things you find in parking lots, the only thing you can use are the cameras. \\n- gaps, it looks like a lego car when you really look into it...\\n- noise insulation is pretty much non existent, you'll be very connected to your surroundings \\n- Drive - over long distances it can be really stressful and tiring for your foot (considering you can't and SHOULD NEVER rely on autopilot - a few trips on the autobahn taught me that the hard way)\\n- \\\"I hear noises\\\" - soon enough you start walking the fine line between paranoia and schizophrenia as squeaks start forming around the car\\n- A/C - heating - as you start the system, especially the AC during summer, you'll hear something comparable to someone taking a can opener and trying to can open your hood; a metal on metal scratch that Tesla Service considers \\\"according to specs / all normal\\\" ; oh and you can't really turn off the air for your passenger, you can only redirect it...\\n\\nThe overall feeling after 1 year of ownership is that I bought into a project/prototype that will never really become anything more. \\n\\nConclusion, a gigantic \\\"DON'T BUY\\\" ! there are other options out there. More so now that it has become a symbol of ignorance and malevolence. \\n\\nP.s. if there are any Tesla competitors out there, I'd be very willing to share a detailed report of the above. They can't be selling all this \\\"smoke\\\" without consequences...\\n\",\"rating\":1,\"labels\":{\"merged\":None,\"verification\":{\"isVerified\":False,\"createdDateTime\":\"2024-11-19T14:18:09.000Z\",\"reviewSourceName\":\"Organic\",\"verificationSource\":\"invitation\",\"verificationLevel\":\"not-verified\",\"hasDachExclusion\":False}},\"title\":\"An honest review of a Tesla Model Y LR '23\",\"likes\":2,\"dates\":{\"experiencedDate\":\"2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2024-11-19T14:18:09.000Z\",\"updatedDate\":None},\"report\":None,\"hasUnhandledReports\":False,\"consumer\":{\"id\":\"5ce67a3ce518558158a98019\",\"displayName\":\"Radu Samson\",\"imageUrl\":\"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5ce67a3ce518558158a98019/73x73.png\",\"numberOfReviews\":4,\"countryCode\":\"DK\",\"hasImage\":true,\"isVerified\":true},\"reply\":None,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameDomain\":1,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameLocation\":None,\"productReviews\":[],\"language\":\"en\",\"location\":None},{\"id\":\"67092b288cfe520d0d50af44\",\"filtered\":False,\"pending\":False,\"text\":\"Following up on an order, I had to visit Tesla store at Guildford.
