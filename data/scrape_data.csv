Jonathan Birge,Worst car buying experience I've ever…,"Worst car buying experience I've ever had. They try to automate everything, but if one thing goes wrong you have no way to talk to a human. They just tell you to go to the app, but nobody answers the messages there. It's like trying to buy a car from a really apathetic robot. I tried to take deliver of my car today, and ended up wasting half my day and came home with the same car I drove there with. Add to that the fact that you have to drive a long distance to get to one of their dealerships, and it's just infuriating they don't have better customer service and have such a cheap bush league purchasing experience.",1,2024-11-26T07:14:03.000Z
Adam,Disappointing Experience with Tesla,"Disappointing Experience with TeslaI have been thoroughly disappointed with Tesla’s customer service and overall approach. Their lack of response to issues is shocking—getting in touch with someone who can actually help is nearly impossible, and when you do, they are extremely unhelpful.Tesla also seems to raise prices whenever they wish, with no regard for customers who have already placed orders or those who have been long-term supporters of the brand. This unpredictability makes it very difficult to trust or plan around their pricing.To make matters worse, Tesla is not regulated in the UK, meaning there is no ombudsman or independent body to hold them accountable for their actions. This leaves customers with little recourse when things go wrong.For a company that claims to lead in innovation and customer experience, they have a long way to go in terms of transparency, accountability, and support.I cannot recommend Tesla based on my experience. Their approach feels dismissive and unreliable, which is not what you expect when purchasing a premium product.",1,2024-11-25T16:50:13.000Z
Angry from Manchester,5/5 for the car. 0/5 for the dealer,"The car (model 3) is excellent, though feels a little cheap compared to ICE cars of a similar price. It's enormous fun to drive and autopilot is awesome. The after sales care is shocking. They deny legal obligations to fix things and the warranty period is less than a Dacia, which is surprising on a £50k car. The things that go wrong are mostly niggles. But you do need the warranty.I think it would be better if they didn't pretend to have a dealer network, for all the good they do. I was expecting a proper company that stands behind their product. That's not what you get.",3,2024-11-18T14:58:54.000Z
John McLean,Utter Rubbish.,"Utter Rubbish.3 owner for the last 3 years. Good start but the reliability went down hill rapidly. Nav, cameras and sensors would stop working repeatedly.

Andrew Haworth,Put a deposit on a cybertruck 4 years…,"Put a deposit on a cybertruck 4 years ago. For the last 2 years I've been trying to contact Tesla for a refund but they never answer the phone. When you login to your online account, the option ""manage order"" takes you to a black screen with a message telling you to contact them on a telephone number. I've been trying to contact them for 2 years and finally got through to them today after waiting over 20 minutes on the phone. Let's hope that refund arrives cos I don't want to wait another 2 years to get through to someone. It took 2 years cos sometimes I ran out of waiting time because I have a job to attend to and a family to look after, and the waiting time has usually been longer than it was today. Don't touch Tesla with a barge pole. Hate to think how long it takes to get hold of them when something goes wrong with the car, and I've heard rumours that things often go wrong with them.",1,2024-11-20T18:43:26.000Z

Daniel,Zero Customer Service,"Cancelled my Model 3 order due to unforeseen circumstances within the 14 day window. Almost a  month later and they have still not refunded my £7000 deposit despite numerous calls, emails and messages, customer service simply doesn't bother to respond.

You don't want to do that, right?!!!If you work for Tesla, or Twitter or SpaceX, or whatever Musk owns, get yourself a decent job! You deserve something much better.Shame on you Musk!

James Cudd,Tesla UK Attempting to Return Car After Diagnosed Steering Failure,"My leased Tesla experienced a complete steering failure while driving on October 19th, nearly causing an accident. The steering fully locked up while the car was in motion and couldn't be 'unlocked' until the car was turned off and on again. What's happened since has revealed deeply concerning practices around Tesla's safety protocols and customer service.The most alarming aspect is this: Tesla's own remote diagnostic system identified a steering rack fault, with the car displaying a ""limited steering may apply"" warning. Yet after two physical inspections, they've claimed they ""couldn't replicate"" the fault and have twice attempted to return the vehicle without any repairs. They even suggested that it might be a 'one off' and if it happens again to undertake a reset on the steering wheel. What if 'it happens again' while driving on a motorway? They're now threatening £40/day storage fees for my refusal to collect a car that their own systems flagged as having a steering issue.This fundamental contradiction between their remote diagnostics and physical inspections remains completely unexplained. How can a car that Tesla's own systems identified as having a fault suddenly be deemed safe for the road without any repairs? This raises serious questions about their safety protocols and diagnostic procedures.Their customer service response has been equally concerning. Safety-critical issues appear to either fall outside their staff's training capabilities or, worse, aren't treated with the gravity they deserve. Responses have been limited to a generic templated email, with no evidence that anyone understands the serious safety implications of returning a vehicle to the road after a diagnosed steering fault.The DVSA is now investigating this safety issue. For a premium brand marketing itself on technology and safety, Tesla's handling of this situation suggests a worrying disconnect between their diagnostic systems, repair protocols, and customer safety. Potential customers should carefully consider whether Tesla has the proper infrastructure and processes to handle serious technical faults before purchase.I am still waiting for a response from them.",1,2024-11-22T20:14:11.000Z
Michael Mullally,Terrible service,"Great car, AWFUL customer service. The car showed delivery in September when I bought it. Then, every day, the 10-day delivery window moved back 1 day. Tesla only has email - no phone number. Email after email after email, no response. Eventually they get back to me and tell me the delay is because of the silver wheels and I can get the car within the week if I went with black. Would have been really helpful if they'd told me that weeks earlier rather than ignoring my communications. They finally give me a delivery date - November 1. The same day I move in to a new house: the main reason I bought the car, and desperately needed the car for that move. Now I've had to spend 4000dkk on a rental car for the move. And still no responses from Tesla, even though they promised to get back to me about compensation. Really, really bad customer support. I choose to lease as I wanted to buy once the new model Y comes out. Now I'll never buy a Tesla based on the terrible service and the staff that just don't care.",1,2024-11-11T16:47:02.000Z

Radu Samson,An honest review of a Tesla Model Y LR '23,"Considering they're censoring all honest reviews, wherever and whenever they can; may this be the only place where one can voice the true value of this ""vehicle"". In short, everything and more of what you hear is true. I've had my Tesla model Y LR for a year now; driven more than 30000km in all sorts of conditions, countries and places. A quick summary: + the interior space is free of annoying buttons, and quite comfortable+ the ability to control everything via the Tesla app, get in and out, preheat/cool the car and share the key with whomever + acceleration - it's now a given for all electric cars but still fun+ tesla charging network, saves you a few minutes on each charge, but most companies are now adapting- Autopilot is a dangerous joke - it's jerky, it tries to kill you on the highway and is in most cases ""out of service"" because one or more cameras are dirty - Windshield wipers: Never in my adult life have I stepped into a car where having to fidget with the wipers has been more needed; in auto mode they'd try and swipe off the light at a traffic light, anything but what they're supposed to. It's clear whoever engineered them hasn't accounted for rain in their calculations- Lights - this is where the other drivers should form some sort of union against being blinded by our tesla's, the light pattern scatters everywhere but where it's supposed to- Paint - in short, there's more and better quality on my toaster. You'll see it right away but there's not much you can do about it- value loss - bought the car the very last days of December, they discounted it by 40000DKK in January ; no message or offer to compensate; Should've prolly just returned it considering the 2 weeks consumer rights thing. - Parking aid - just as autopilot, only trust it if you wanna spend your money fixing the car; the 3D projection is often off and doesn't account for smaller obstacles...as most of the pillars / poles or other things you find in parking lots, the only thing you can use are the cameras. - gaps, it looks like a lego car when you really look into it...- noise insulation is pretty much non existent, you'll be very connected to your surroundings - Drive - over long distances it can be really stressful and tiring for your foot (considering you can't and SHOULD NEVER rely on autopilot - a few trips on the autobahn taught me that the hard way)- ""I hear noises"" - soon enough you start walking the fine line between paranoia and schizophrenia as squeaks start forming around the car- A/C - heating - as you start the system, especially the AC during summer, you'll hear something comparable to someone taking a can opener and trying to can open your hood; a metal on metal scratch that Tesla Service considers ""according to specs / all normal"" ; oh and you can't really turn off the air for your passenger, you can only redirect it...The overall feeling after 1 year of ownership is that I bought into a project/prototype that will never really become anything more. Conclusion, a gigantic ""DON'T BUY"" ! there are other options out there. More so now that it has become a symbol of ignorance and malevolence. P.s. if there are any Tesla competitors out there, I'd be very willing to share a detailed report of the above. They can't be selling all this ""smoke"" without consequences...",1,2024-11-19T14:18:09.000Z
David Brown,I have a Tesla lease,"I have a Tesla lease. When I decided to move provinces I learn that the insurance company needs a form from Tesla Finance to be able to cancel the insurance in the first province. I have been trying to get this from them for 2 months. They won't respond so I'm stuck paying an extra $250 / month in insurance because they won't provide a simple document. No one will respond at all and there is no one to complain to. The only people at Tesla you can contact are sales people to sell you a car. When you need something after that you're on own. Goodbye!

Yazan Tk,Bad experience,"I applied to purchase a Tesla in Houston Tx , when I went to pick it up at the Cypress location, I was shocked to find a front bumper damage on the car. Despite multiple requests, they neither replaced the car nor offered any compensation. Later, $300 was deducted as a reservation fee and $50 for insurance without prior notice. After numerous attempts to communicate, the response was entirely unhelpful.

If anything goes wrong, expect no one to take any responsibility, or be remotely helpful in resolving issues. Staff can barely make eye contact with you to begin with, and when there was a mix up with trading-in my current Tesla- caused by their staff misinforming me - I was treated with contempt, rather than as a customer with any value. In the follow up weeks where I repeatedly had to email a member of staff - Louis Galvani - who was meant to return my key cards to me, I was simply ignored. Aside from using the app, getting in touch with a human to get anything done or raise a complaint is clearly made deliberately difficult and there is no desire to give good customer service, despite the expense of a car to most people. This seems to be their business model, and if this is the future, then count me out.
