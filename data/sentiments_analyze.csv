Jonathan Birge,Worst car buying experience I've ever,Worst car buying experience I've ever had They try to automate everything but if one thing goes wrong you have no way to talk to a human They just tell you to go to the app but nobody answers the messages there It's like trying to buy a car from a really apathetic robot I tried to take deliver of my car today and ended up wasting half my day and came home with the same car I drove there with Add to that the fact that you have to drive a long distance to get to one of their dealerships and it's just infuriating they don't have better customer service and have such a cheap bush league purchasing experience,1,2024-11-26,-0.11060606060606061,-0.9672
Adam,Disappointing Experience with Tesla,Disappointing Experience with TeslaI have been thoroughly disappointed with Tesla s customer service and overall approach Their lack of response to issues is shocking getting in touch with someone who can actually help is nearly impossible and when you do they are extremely unhelpful Tesla also seems to raise prices whenever they wish with no regard for customers who have already placed orders or those who have been long term supporters of the brand This unpredictability makes it very difficult to trust or plan around their pricing To make matters worse Tesla is not regulated in the UK meaning there is no ombudsman or independent body to hold them accountable for their actions This leaves customers with little recourse when things go wrong For a company that claims to lead in innovation and customer experience they have a long way to go in terms of transparency accountability and support I cannot recommend Tesla based on my experience Their approach feels dismissive and unreliable which is not what you expect when purchasing a premium product,1,2024-11-25,-0.35565476190476186,-0.8331
Angry from Manchester,5 5 for the car 0 5 for the dealer,The car model 3 is excellent though feels a little cheap compared to ICE cars of a similar price It's enormous fun to drive and autopilot is awesome The after sales care is shocking They deny legal obligations to fix things and the warranty period is less than a Dacia which is surprising on a 50k car The things that go wrong are mostly niggles But you do need the warranty I think it would be better if they didn't pretend to have a dealer network for all the good they do I was expecting a proper company that stands behind their product That's not what you get,3,2024-11-18,0.1791666666666667,0.9279

Andrew Haworth,Put a deposit on a cybertruck 4 years,Put a deposit on a cybertruck 4 years ago For the last 2 years I've been trying to contact Tesla for a refund but they never answer the phone When you login to your online account the option manage order takes you to a black screen with a message telling you to contact them on a telephone number I've been trying to contact them for 2 years and finally got through to them today after waiting over 20 minutes on the phone Let's hope that refund arrives cos I don't want to wait another 2 years to get through to someone It took 2 years cos sometimes I ran out of waiting time because I have a job to attend to and a family to look after and the waiting time has usually been longer than it was today Don't touch Tesla with a barge pole Hate to think how long it takes to get hold of them when something goes wrong with the car and I've heard rumours that things often go wrong with them,1,2024-11-20,-0.2833333333333333,-0.8856

James Cudd,Tesla UK Attempting to Return Car After Diagnosed Steering Failure,My leased Tesla experienced a complete steering failure while driving on October 19th nearly causing an accident The steering fully locked up while the car was in motion and couldn't be 'unlocked' until the car was turned off and on again What's happened since has revealed deeply concerning practices around Tesla's safety protocols and customer service The most alarming aspect is this Tesla's own remote diagnostic system identified a steering rack fault with the car displaying a limited steering may apply warning Yet after two physical inspections they've claimed they couldn't replicate the fault and have twice attempted to return the vehicle without any repairs They even suggested that it might be a 'one off' and if it happens again to undertake a reset on the steering wheel What if 'it happens again' while driving on a motorway They're now threatening 40 day storage fees for my refusal to collect a car that their own systems flagged as having a steering issue This fundamental contradiction between their remote diagnostics and physical inspections remains completely unexplained How can a car that Tesla's own systems identified as having a fault suddenly be deemed safe for the road without any repairs This raises serious questions about their safety protocols and diagnostic procedures Their customer service response has been equally concerning Safety critical issues appear to either fall outside their staff's training capabilities or worse aren't treated with the gravity they deserve Responses have been limited to a generic templated email with no evidence that anyone understands the serious safety implications of returning a vehicle to the road after a diagnosed steering fault The DVSA is now investigating this safety issue For a premium brand marketing itself on technology and safety Tesla's handling of this situation suggests a worrying disconnect between their diagnostic systems repair protocols and customer safety Potential customers should carefully consider whether Tesla has the proper infrastructure and processes to handle serious technical faults before purchase I am still waiting for a response from them,1,2024-11-22,0.04807987711213515,-0.9214
Michael Mullally,Terrible service,Great car AWFUL customer service The car showed delivery in September when I bought it Then every day the 10 day delivery window moved back 1 day Tesla only has email no phone number Email after email after email no response Eventually they get back to me and tell me the delay is because of the silver wheels and I can get the car within the week if I went with black Would have been really helpful if they'd told me that weeks earlier rather than ignoring my communications They finally give me a delivery date November 1 The same day I move in to a new house the main reason I bought the car and desperately needed the car for that move Now I've had to spend 4000dkk on a rental car for the move And still no responses from Tesla even though they promised to get back to me about compensation Really really bad customer support I choose to lease as I wanted to buy once the new model Y comes out Now I'll never buy a Tesla based on the terrible service and the staff that just don't care,1,2024-11-11,-0.1192513368983957,-0.9231

Radu Samson,An honest review of a Tesla Model Y LR '23,Considering they're censoring all honest reviews wherever and whenever they can may this be the only place where one can voice the true value of this vehicle In short everything and more of what you hear is true I've had my Tesla model Y LR for a year now driven more than 30000km in all sorts of conditions countries and places A quick summary the interior space is free of annoying buttons and quite comfortable the ability to control everything via the Tesla app get in and out preheat cool the car and share the key with whomever acceleration it's now a given for all electric cars but still fun tesla charging network saves you a few minutes on each charge but most companies are now adapting Autopilot is a dangerous joke it's jerky it tries to kill you on the highway and is in most cases out of service because one or more cameras are dirty Windshield wipers Never in my adult life have I stepped into a car where having to fidget with the wipers has been more needed in auto mode they'd try and swipe off the light at a traffic light anything but what they're supposed to It's clear whoever engineered them hasn't accounted for rain in their calculations Lights this is where the other drivers should form some sort of union against being blinded by our tesla's the light pattern scatters everywhere but where it's supposed to Paint in short there's more and better quality on my toaster You'll see it right away but there's not much you can do about it value loss bought the car the very last days of December they discounted it by 40000DKK in January no message or offer to compensate Should've prolly just returned it considering the 2 weeks consumer rights thing Parking aid just as autopilot only trust it if you wanna spend your money fixing the car the 3D projection is often off and doesn't account for smaller obstacles as most of the pillars poles or other things you find in parking lots the only thing you can use are the cameras gaps it looks like a lego car when you really look into it noise insulation is pretty much non existent you'll be very connected to your surroundings Drive over long distances it can be really stressful and tiring for your foot considering you can't and SHOULD NEVER rely on autopilot a few trips on the autobahn taught me that the hard way I hear noises soon enough you start walking the fine line between paranoia and schizophrenia as squeaks start forming around the car A C heating as you start the system especially the AC during summer you'll hear something comparable to someone taking a can opener and trying to can open your hood a metal on metal scratch that Tesla Service considers according to specs all normal oh and you can't really turn off the air for your passenger you can only redirect it The overall feeling after 1 year of ownership is that I bought into a project prototype that will never really become anything more Conclusion a gigantic DON'T BUY there are other options out there More so now that it has become a symbol of ignorance and malevolence P s if there are any Tesla competitors out there I'd be very willing to share a detailed report of the above They can't be selling all this smoke without consequences,1,2024-11-19,0.14831821617535904,0.8862

Yerjanik Cuellar,Tesla lost its respect to the customers,Experiencing the bitter bite of Tesla's discount department it's clear that unexpected charges heartache are becoming the norm for us the consumers On May 17 2024 I decided to return my leased vehicle excited to purchase a new one Little did I know a hefty bill of 4500 was lurking around the corner landing in my inbox just four days later No prior warning no explanation just a cold robotic response It's as if the human element the very essence of customer service has been completely replaced by algorithms Transparency once a cornerstone of Tesla's brand now seems to be lost amidst the shuffle of layoffs and restructuring Where is the service that was once promised Where is the respect for the customer that was once a priority It's disheartening to see a brand I once admired now seemingly indifferent to its customers' experiences It's high time Tesla revisits its commitment to transparency and customer service rather than leaving its customers in the dark grappling with unexpected charges Let's stand against these UnfairCharges Let's voice our TeslaTroubles Let's demand better CustomerServiceMatters,1,2024-05-23,0.06021464646464647,0.4829

Jamie Downs,Why is s it so hard to speak to someone,I've had a Tesla for around a year and it recently started making clicking noise whilst accelerating as well as making a noise inside like the wind is blowing This is whilst stationary or moving It sounds like it is coming from the vent You can still hear it when the fans aircon is switched off I also needed to get some new tires due to uneven wear at the back Although the outside of the tires looked good The inside was down to the material Lucky I checked The above didn't bother me too much because the car is under warranty Not the tyres obviously I used the app to find a service centre and to my horror the nearest one was over an hour away I live in Oxford not a remote island in Scotland Who wants to drive for an hour to a garage There used to be one in Reading I got my tires elsewhere and decided to live with the windy interior and clicking noise Then over the weekend one of the updates failed I had no choice but get in touch with Tesla I raised a ticket and got a message saying they had reset something Now it gets stuck at 50 downloading the update I messaged back informing them of this I was told this would be sent to the technicians to troubleshoot Since then I've heard nothing It's been all day I've asked for updates but heard nothing In the meantime many of the features including FSD are not working and something is draining the battery My guess is it is continually trying to download the update I'd heard customer service was supposed to be good Why of why is it so hard to speak to someone any more Yes I know the answer Come on Tesla prove me wrong,1,2024-09-24,0.07913921826965303,0.528

Adrian Meneses,I purchased the auto steer function,I purchased the auto steer function about a week ago based on a friends recommendation I was not aware you had to use it in a certain way to comply with Telsa I was paused from using it for a week after a couple of days So I paid a little over 100 for something that I can not even use because I am not using it the way Tesla wants me to use it I called to get a refund and was denied one I would have never purchased this upgrade if I knew I had to use it a certain way Using auto steer while having my hands on the steering wheel and looking at traffic at all times completely defeats the purpose of why I purchased the upgrade I might as well drive the car myself I spoke very highly of Tesla before and recommended it to friends and family As a result of this experience I will do the opposite going forward When I called I was expecting to speak to people that would understand my situation that logically no one should pay for something they can not use If not then give me a refund Tesla should steal a page from successful companies like Amazon who practice TRUST with their consumers They accept returns all the time without hesistation because they understand the value behind customer loyalty based on amazing customer service I highly doubt Elon Musk would have approved of how my call was handdled today Rules exists but there is always exceptions Oh well the good thing is that other manufactures produce electric cars now Bye Telsa,1,2024-07-26,0.1456047619047619,0.9594

Raphael Joseph,Selling our Tesla ASAP regret buying,In summary I love the actual car Tesla Y I would say it is best car I have owned However there is a fundamental flaw in the entire Tesla business model and experience that in my opinion should stop anyone buying a Tesla I will certainly never buy one again and am going to sell my current one as a result The problem is that you are at the mercy of Tesla for your servicing parts and basically any issue you have If there happens to be an available person to fix your problem then great the service experience is quite good especially the mobile one However if there noone available this is where the gaping hole in their offering exists As an example the middle seat belt buckle in our car broke We regularly need to take three children in the back of the car After booking a mobile service for two weeks in advance it was cancelled by Tesla and then rebooked for 2 months later Obviously this was not an option as we can not have anyone especially kids in the back of the car with no seatbelt However there was no alternative I offered to drive a hundred miles to another service centre Not an option I offered to fit it myself Not an option No other garage could fix it so we were dependent on Tesla They would not agree to offering us a complimentary car in the meantime In the end after hours of calls with Tesla lovely customer service personnel it was agreed I could drive 45 minutes to a service centre first thing in the morning and they would fix it I had to take half a day off work last minute and change all plans Suffice to say we need to sell our car quickly before something else goes wrong as we cannot be left in this situation again Such a shame but until this situation changes Tesla is unfortunately not a car company I could recommend to anyone in the UK,1,2024-07-06,0.17073412698412696,0.7172

Myles McHugh,Staff are rude and unhelpful Awful customers service Con artists,Staff are rude cut throat and unhelpful If you want to pay a good amount for a car then be treated like a piece of dirt buy a car from Auckland Tesla I paid for the black paint within 10 days the car was covered in chips bonnet doors front of car The paint is awful very thin and does not withhold any impact Tesla don t care they take your money say its not covered under warranty then dismiss you I raised a complaint and was told it was being investigated After not hearing anything back for 3 months I called back and dealt with the obnoxious assistant manager in Auckland He repeated what was on the notes from 3 months ago and no further investigation had been done I contacted an independent paint specialist and they said the paint on Tesla s is extremely thin and poor with many customers having the same issues since production was moved to China They advised me that many people are paying over 8k to have their car fully wrapped from new which completely defeats the purpose of paying extra money to have the car in a different colour In addition I had a rattle in the inside of the car from new I m now approaching my 3rd time having to drive from Tauranga to Hamilton to get it fixed but this time I need to wait over 40 days to get it fixed Do not buy Tesla unless you live close to a service centre it s extremely inconvenient when things go wrong You are expected to drive to Auckland or Hamilton to get anything done I was also mis sold the car under the premise of getting the clean car rebate on the website when you buy the car it told you under the finance section that the 7k incentive was discounted from the car However I never got this as I purchased in November and received the car in March Post purchasing the car they knocked the prices down by 7k in March When I discussed this with the manager the basically told me that it never displayed this on the website I have screenshots that I signed the purchase agreement and basically tough luck we reduced the price and you missed out The car is a dream to drive and lovely inside had I not been treated like dirt and had received some kind of human customer service experience post buying the car I would have probably been happy But based on the Auckland Tesla experience I will never buy a Tesla product again Now time to sell my shares I think,1,2024-08-30,-0.0044386724386724415,0.8507

Eric Hoerdemann,I have gone from Tesla's biggest fan to neutral to negative,I have owned a Tesla for several years Over time I have gone from Tesla's biggest fan to neutral to now negative The battery mileage has fallen dramatically over the course of the last 1 2 years and the car has become increasingly glitchy over time Most troubling was a glitch that resulted in the car being unable to charge while I was on a trip and was far from my home The final straw for me however is my inability to get anyone on the phone from Tesla sales Given my very positive experience with Tesla in the first year of ownership I thought perhaps the issues I was experiencing were related to the age of the car and a smaller battery I decided I would give Tesla another try and responding to one of the promotions they sent me I attempted to buy another Tesla upgrading to a higher battery capacity I was unable to purchase the car online due to a fault in the Tesla web site despite being a current owner the system had me in the wrong state and associated my account with another order I never made preventing from placing an order I also needed to speak to someone briefly for a simple clarifying question I simply could not connect with a human being in any form phone in person dealership or even website messaging I have become extraordinarily frustrated making multiple attempts to call Tesla going through a series of extended prompts before the line hung up after a message that the Tesla phone system was down If you cannot get someone on the phone to buy a new car imagine how hard it will be in the future to find help when something goes wrong I also cannot find any form to share my feedback directly with Tesla further damaging goodwill I have gone from an advocate influencing many Tesla purchases to now the opposite I advise all of my friends and contacts be very careful before considering buying a Tesla,1,2024-05-23,-0.049075126262626265,-0.9265

KALAISELVI MUDALIAR,Tesla s Shocking Lack of Customer Service A Total Disappointment,As a Tesla owner I expected the company s service to match the prestige of its brand Unfortunately my experience with Tesla's customer service has been nothing short of appalling The level of indifference and disregard for customer concerns is astonishing for a company of this stature From the very beginning Tesla s service team has failed to address my concerns with any seriousness Despite my repeated efforts to escalate my issue regarding the poor service quality I have been met with nothing but dismissive and unhelpful responses Most notably the attitude of Tesla s Customer Business Resolutions Partner was shockingly bad They displayed no willingness to listen to or understand the problem I raised Instead of acknowledging my concerns they seemed more interested in deflecting the issue entirely making the interaction frustrating and stressful I have tried to make it clear that my concerns revolve around the substandard level of service provided by Tesla but instead of addressing the root of the problem they diverted the conversation toward irrelevant matters such as my finance provider Black Horse Finance which has absolutely no bearing on my complaint It s alarming that a company that prides itself on innovation and excellence allows such a poor level of customer interaction Tesla s inability to listen coupled with the rude and dismissive attitude of their staff shows a complete lack of respect for their customers The entire experience has been frustrating and disappointing with no meaningful resolution in sight Tesla needs to drastically rethink how they handle customer service and ensure their staff are trained to listen and respond to genuine concerns as this is completely unacceptable If this is the standard of service Tesla is offering I will seriously reconsider my future with the brand I strongly urge the ownership and leadership of Tesla in the USA particularly Elon Musk to take a closer look at the feedback coming from UK customers The current state of customer service in the UK does not align with Tesla s global reputation and it desperately needs intervention from the top Until Tesla takes responsibility and drastically improves their service standards I cannot in good faith recommend the brand to others I will also be reconsidering my future with Tesla if these issues persist,1,2024-09-16,-0.04767441860465116,-0.9905

David,Don't Buy Tesla Solar Panels Until They Resolve This Known Issue,I bought Tesla solar for my house after a great experience buying a Tesla vehicle and because I was shopping for solar panels anyway The purchase was made in late 2023 and the install happened around March Finally in April everything went live I noticed immediately that the wiring seemed off and certain appliances started to trip on the breaker panel Our fridge would suddenly be turned off and we'd notice it was due to the breaker Tesla installed We replaced the breaker at our own expense Next we noticed the Tesla app stating the house was using 0 kw for the entire house anytime the air conditioning came on This obviously makes no sense and it couldn't be true This resulted in our system reporting more electricity being sold back to the grid than we were actually selling back I contacted Tesla about this and they claimed that my system was running fine on their end and they showed no errors in my configuration I kept telling them they needed to send someone out but they initially refused unless I paid 300 service call fee At some point about week later Tesla then emailed me saying my system shows signs of errors and they need to send someone out Someone first came out in early June They claimed the system was running fine but that I needed a new unit that housed the fan but that the fan couldn't be replaced alone they'd have to replace the entire unit I forgot the name he called it During that visit I showed the Tesla technician the app and what it reported when the AC came on He claimed it was an app issue and if I logged out and deleted the app and reinstalled it it would be fixed I did this and it didn't work He scheduled another technician to come out in late June to replace the unit When this technician came he claimed there was an issue with the Tesla system and that he addressed it He told me that he would call me the next day to check that it was fixed and he did not The issues remained By now I'm getting bills from my electricity company TEP with major discrepancies compared to what the Tesla app shows that I'm selling back to the grid and using etc I then received a very high electricity bill for 274 the same amounts I would receive in the summer here in Arizona if I had no solar panels At this I was infuriated because I'm paying a similar amount for the solar panels and my expectation was that it would drastically reduce my bills this being the 3rd month being live I then went back on the Tesla app and chatted with service for help I told them the entire story I asked Tesla to reimburse me for the months that I've been paying for solar panels without them working properly I explained the new issues to Tesla 1 The fridge in my house is still randomly tripping off on the panel this started happening after the solar installation 2 The app still shows that the home is using 0 kW at times when that is clearly not the case It usually does this when the Air Conditioner comes on 3 At night the system is falsely showing that it receives energy from the sun It is charging my Tesla vehicle and it should only be charging on solar above 45 It charges at night somehow because the system falsely says it is receiving solar energy in the middle of the night 4 At times it shows the home is using 7 7 kW while no major appliances are on i e the AC which usually is responsible for driving up the power usage Then when the AC comes on the kW being used actually drops significantly to 1 2 kW Tesla told me that I need a Whole Home Cycle or reboot for the system The process was emailed to me and I was told to wait 24 hours to see if the problems persisted The problems persisted I then asked Tesla again to send someone out and rewire the system and investigate this properly I asked also for a refund of months paid because in essence they've sold me a defective product Tesla refused saying they don't reimburse in such instances I told them they need to either fix the problem or take the panels off and cancel the purchse and provide a refund They now have said they're sending more technicians over on 7 24 24 to invetigate the issue Meanwhile the system is still faulty I have no idea of how much energy I'm actually using and what's being sold back to the grid The system says I'm generating solar in the middle of the night without the sun This is what I would expect from a very amateur and scammish company not Tesla Highly disappointed in the service and the product's functionality I hope Tesla responds here and gets this addressed Otherwise I hope this thread warns and stops people from buying Tesla solar until they fix this very known issue,1,2024-07-20,0.046892316017316034,-0.6986

gcanete,RN122059154 awful experience,Tesla USA Florida John young store Don't buy Tesla to whom it may concern This started when I had a car accident and I lost total destruction of my car and a friend of mine told me tryout the Tesla that it's a good car I rent it for 10 days and I liked it so I bought the home charger and installed it first before buying the car because I knew I was going to buy the Tesla I received an email on June 20 from a Tesla advisor Rachel Pilon offering a promotion that was extended until June 30 2024 where they offer the new model 3 Long Range AWD car enjoy the 7500 federal credit incentive and the option of 2 99 APR for 48 60 months attached copy of the original email without just thinking about making the purchase online On June 21 I made the reservation and paid 250 Fill out all the forms and I was approved quickly On the financial side I see that the APR was 6 14 and not the 2 99 they had offered Below I send a message informing of this situation and asking you to Honor the offer and with the long wait for an unsatisfactory answer answer on June 27 they let me know that the promotion of the 2 99APR was for the model 3 Rear wheel drive standard range which can not honor the offer Then disagreeing with the situation talking to my wife that I thought and we could do we decided to go ahead with the purchase of the offer car so we could have 2 99 APR Then changing options we decided to buy the Model 3 Long Range AWD by sacrificing 2 99 APR and accepting the interest of 6 14 APR Being 3 times at the Tesla dealership and being attended by the best Thais sales advisor excellent person she shows me the new model 3 performance I really liked the Performance and being in discrepancies with my wife we decided to continue with the purchase of the Model 3 Long Range AWD losing the insentive of the 2 99 APR that they never honored Being on deadline for the promotion to end June 30 the day before I went back to the dealer to talk to Thais because I wanted to pay for it with my own financing of a lower interest of 5 2 APR with another bank previously I talked to my wife letting her know that I wanted to change the car for the Performance and between and rounds I managed to convince her of the change Day June 29 talking to Thais sales advisor letting her know the changes she tells me that if you can make the change of the car to the new Performance and using my own financing but that you can not go over the limit of 55 000 Because you would not be given the federal credit of 7500 And that the car had to be ordered in gray its exterior and the interior white and that it had to wait between July and August for the delivery of the car accepting these conditions we proceed to the new order Thais asks my permission to speak with her manager Maria who I never saw or didn't show up Thais lets me know that he has a new proposal or offer that in order not to change to another bank for financing and stay with Tesla's financing at 6 14 APR that there was a Performance car available because another owner canceled the order on the condition that the vehicle was white exterior with white interior I had to do it on that same day because we are at the end of the month promotion but since it was white it went over the budget of 1000 and that manager Maria could take the extra 1000 off she confirmed it 2 times for the white color and that is the only way they could give me the federal credit of 7 500 Accept the offer by resigning my own 5 2 APR finance And going to see the new white Model 3 Performance car getting on it and feeling the beautiful feeling of my new car and leaving aside everything Tesla failed against me from the beginning I asked Thais to w clean my car for the delivery of the last day June 30 my son's birthday which my wife was upset with me bc not being with my son and going to get the vehicle When I left at 6 30pm on the afternoon of June 29 from the dealer and I called my brother to help me taking me to pick up the car next day and letting him know that I had bought a beautiful car that I loved and 5 minutes later after I left the dealer I get a call from the Tesla Dealership and Thais lets me know that manager Maria told her that unfortunately they had not approved the 1000 discount for the white color and for that reason they can not give me the 7 500 federal credit At that time all the love to the company Tesla is gone from love to hate there is only one step was shocked speechless and Thais tells me that we can still continue with the original order of the gray and white exterior Performance My answer was very quick and sincere I don't want to know about Tesla again Tesla at John young Orlando Florida be careful Thank you Thais for your attention Hopefully Tesla can improve and not fool people Gustavo Canete,1,2024-07-04,0.17652717652717656,0.9964
Dev Joshi,Tesla's Disregard for Customer Feedback Service Issues and Lack of Follow Up,Tesla's operations in New Zealand have faced significant criticism from customers highlighting various issues related to service support pricing and overall customer experience Service and Support One of the most common complaints concerns Tesla's service and support infrastructure Many customers have reported a lack of responsiveness and support from Tesla's staff This includes challenges with getting timely repairs and maintenance as well as difficulties in receiving satisfactory customer service Reports suggest that the service team often fails to address issues effectively or offer solutions in a timely manner Additionally customers have noted that Tesla employees frequently exhibit a lack of professionalism and are not particularly helpful or customer friendly This extends to a lack of accountability with employees often unwilling to escalate issues to higher management or provide appropriate resolutions Pricing Issues Pricing is another significant point of contention Early adopters of Tesla vehicles in New Zealand have faced high costs compared to those who purchase newer models The initial prices paid by early customers were considerably higher and they often had to purchase additional items or features that are now included as standard in newer more affordable models This disparity has left many early buyers feeling that they were unfairly charged and that Tesla did not offer adequate value for the premium they paid Customer Experience and Complaints Handling The overall customer experience is marred by a lack of effective complaint management Tesla's handling of complaints in New Zealand has been described as inadequate with customers frequently reporting that their complaints are not properly registered or acknowledged The process for lodging a complaint is often frustrating as customers have found that their issues are not given proper attention and are not assigned reference numbers This lack of structured complaint management contributes to a feeling of neglect and frustration among customers Access to Management Another major issue is the difficulty in reaching higher management or more senior personnel within the company Customers have reported being unable to speak to managers or those in higher positions when seeking resolution for their issues This lack of access to decision makers compounds the problem as it prevents customers from addressing their concerns with individuals who have the authority to make meaningful changes or offer effective resolutions Even the parent company in the U S and Australia seems disinterested in addressing customer concerns They send out surveys after service appointments but rarely follow up on the feedback,1,2024-09-12,0.12779980657640228,-0.8786
August,Tesla Nightmare,Where do I start I leased a Model 3 performance The car was delivered to my home I stayed in the 3 year lease and returned it as soon as the window to return was available Some items for future buyers to be aware of as I won t be back because of it I leased from a dealer in Las Vegas and had to move to the east coast for work The process of transferring a leased title is a complete nightmare Customer service only responds via email and it took 8 months to complete transferring registration to another state Beware most states require registration within 30 90 days I broke that and the only way around it for me was to have the dmv place my car under an exception status This costs about 400 Customer service is hands down the worst I ve had to deal with You can t get a hold of a physical person You can call all the numbers you want and follow the prompts but everyone ends up at the same point Email Tesla and wait for a response Super annoying when you have time pressing issues Service side was equally as bad I had to use it twice and both times was a complete nightmare First I blew a tire was stranded in the side of the road You call Tesla road side assistance I was on hold for 2 hours Finally got a tow truck beware Tesla requires the car to be fixed at a Tesla service center The closet one was 5 hours away They didn t have the tire had to wait 3 days to get one Had to find a place to stay for my wife and 2 year old son Trip was ruined Tesla could care less They offered us water when we arrived which was nice 2nd time service appointment was because of self driving issues It didn t matter what I was passing on the road it would randomly brake hard 75 mph down to 10 mph Tesla said they grabbed some log files and noticed a glitch in their software They disabled full self driving until they could get a patch in place This took 6 months or so It didn t fix the issue completely Didn t use self driving much after that Cold weather is hard on Tesla My fully electric Volvo does just fine in the same temperature Battery will drain fast 80 to 10 in 24 hours Plugged in it drained 80 to 30 in 24 hours Tesla said the car is required to be in a heated garage in the winter Turn in day finally Everything is done from the app Take a bunch of pictures and submit them to Tesla It took about 3 days for them to get back to me If you tinted your windows 375 per window to remove I got this down to 350 for all 4 I tried to get someone to do it cheaper and Tesla fought me on it Said any repairs or modifications to the car has to be done through a Tesla service center If you scratch you wheels it s common Tesla charges 125 for every inch of scratch Their website says 3 inches Tesla fought me tooth and nail on this one Ended up just paying it I lived about 12 hours from the nearest Tesla dealer FYI there are no Tesla dealers in Montana Wyoming North South Dakota If you live in those areas you will have to drive to Denver Salt Lake to return it Total pain and I had to fly home to get home after it all Tesla said they will be opening up dealers in this states starting in 2030 FYI I got charged a window washing fee due to bugs on window after driving 12 hours to Denver They ended up removing the 250 after I went outside and cleaned it myself All in all the first quote to turn in was priced at 14 3k Took a while to get Tesla to understand the charges were BS Final bill costs me just shy of 4k to return my Tesla It had 15k miles It was practically brand new I have pics of it all and the charges emails if anyone wants to see I won t go back Sorry Elon Stick to shooting stuff into space Best of luck everyone,1,2024-06-23,-0.0003382034632034609,-0.6587

Christina Jordan,After purchasing two vehicles from,After purchasing two vehicles from Tesla in recent years I feel compelled to caution others against making the same choice While Tesla's cars may have impressive features the lack of adequate customer support and devaluing customers current vehicles to make sales are glaring flaws that should not be ignored Our attempts to reach out for assistance through the app have been met with silence leaving us frustrated and without solutions to our problems The phone support system only adds to the frustration leading us in circles and often ending with unhelpful responses from representatives who lack the necessary knowledge to address our concerns Most concerning is the significant devaluation of our car which has plummeted by 49 000 from its original purchase price This drastic drop in value raises serious questions about Tesla's pricing strategies and the long term viability of their vehicles in the market Furthermore despite having several Tesla chargers in our medical office for other vehicles to use we have decided to permanently remove them Our concerns about Tesla as a company and our reluctance to promote anything related to their vehicles have led us to this decision For those considering an electric vehicle I strongly advise exploring other options before committing to Tesla The subpar customer support concerning devaluation of assets and broader company concerns are red flags that cannot be overlooked A company's commitment to customer satisfaction ethical practices and the resale value of their products should be key considerations when making such a significant investment,1,2024-04-10,0.09409722222222222,0.9566

off gba,Appalling customer service,Title Disappointed in Tesla's Service A Customer's PerspectiveAs a proud Tesla owner for three years I've always sung praises for the brand until now My recent experience with their service support for cracked rims has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and disappointed When I encountered an issue with my rims I expected the same level of prompt and efficient service that I've come to associate with Tesla However what followed was a nightmare of being bounced around from one department to another with no real solution in sight Despite reaching out for assistance it felt like I was being pushed from pillar to post with no one willing to take responsibility for resolving the issue Requests for a technician to replace the rim were met with resistance and I found myself stuck in a bureaucratic loop between breakdown call outs and the vehicle service part of the app The entire ordeal has been needlessly protracted taking nearly three days to sort out a timeframe that is simply unacceptable especially when I'm away on business and relying on my vehicle This experience has genuinely shaken my confidence in Tesla as a brand As someone who has been a loyal advocate I never imagined that I would be driven to consider switching to another manufacturer But the lack of support and resolution in this instance has left me with no choice but to explore alternative optioMoving forward I hope that Tesla takes customer service,2,2024-04-03,-0.056481481481481494,0.5338

Oliver Weeks,Ridiculous,Ridiculous awful gas lighters The cars are great when they work but as for the service and after care It would be difficult to create a worse service by design I thought buying a used vehicle directly from Tesla still under warranty and with very low mileage would be a good idea I was wrong Firstly they kept delaying the pick up date without consult you have to keep checking the app for changes they will do this last minute without warning and will never apologise for the inconvenience They sold me a car that had been subject to a prior major repair Before handing over my money I directly asked them if the vehicle was 'ex repair' to which they lied and categorically stated over the phone that it was not I have finally thank goodness sold this vehicle and I feel immense relief It's like getting out of a bad toxic relationship The lovely co who have bought the car from me cited several things wrong with it that should have apparently been addressed before Tesla ever sold it to me this includes faded headlights Luckily these are still under warranty otherwise that's a 3000 fix I took the car for repair last year after I hit a curb causing a flat tire and a small dent I referred the car to Tesla when it came back they had not addressed the bodywork and refused to remediate this gaslighting me and then just completely ignoring me They also by policy refuse to correspond with any insurance companies whatsoever so its impossible to make a claim unless you mediate it yourself and dedicate enormous time to this dozens of hours lost utter frustration and you really do need to know your rights in common law to get this done at all I went to collect the 'repaired' vehicle form the Tesla centre but immediately noticed the key and charging cables were missing I asked if I could have these back to which I was advised by a Tesla employee there that no one could help me and that I should leave and come back another time What This actually got me and my GF stuck at Christmas unable to find a charging station that had the old type 2 EV hose Yes they sold me a car in 2023 without the CCS adaptor upgrade and then stole all the adaptors and I didn't see these back for 4 months Ever since then things got even worse There has been issue after issue with often dire and obnoxious service From their side there has been blame gaslighting and they have even miss 'quoted' me back to myself with either completely 'out of context statements' or blatant falsehoods If I had any energy left I would make a claim for damages and extortion The repair itself didn't address the body work so I was left out of pocket having concluded my affairs with the insurance company obviously They replaced the wheel with a different colour grey not black and the front fender was still bent When I complained I was told the service centre should never have accepted the repair in the first place as they were not suitable to carry out 'that kind of the work' What the AF When I then asked how Tesla proposed to remedy this they simply said there was nothing they could do I even tried to book it in for a service and they then deleted the conversation on the app chat One week later the heater blew up Went to get this fixed at a different service centre Following the initial repair I noticed rattling vibration noises Went to have this looked at again by Tesla twice was told I was imagining things Twice Since then charge port broke Then wing mirror Both issues were covered under warranty but Tesla tried to charge me through the app they will do this hoping that some will pay They will try to weasel out of any warranty claim or gaslight you by telling you the issue does not exists I had this with the wing mirror and the charge port In both cases being sent away and told the problem wasn't present Eventually they did replace these This general narrative has occurred every time there has been an issue I have many examples of their B S but I now feel myself 'ageing' writing this review I am not overstating things when I say that owning this car and dealing with Telsa has taken me to some emotionally dark places these interactions have made life genuinely unbearable at times Never an apology I was fobbed off and lied to they'll even steal your cables and keys and then ignore you when you ask for them back Utter disgrace They will never take responsibility for warranty issues or bodged work and to make things even worse the value of my car halved since I bought it only 10 months ago due to their terrible reputation and known dreadful service It was of course overpriced in the first place I feel an enormous sense of relief having finally gotten rid if it Never again Mercedes EQS next A company that actually cares about their customers,1,2024-03-15,-0.05913461538461537,-0.9953

Talaat Eltayeb,The tesla Team in Ontario the Good The Bad the Ugly,After my experience with the Tesla team in buying a new 2024 tesla model Y I came to the conclusion that traditional dealers are far better than tesla personnel in dealing with their customers They are well trained in making you feel important unlike tesla personnel who rely more on the reputation of the product and it looks like their real subconscious motto is you take it or leave it Don't expect good communication regarding step by step requirements along the process Also don't expect consistency when you talk to more than one person In my case I was asked to provide a lein release letter for my trade in car but only a few hours before the delivery time Because it usually takes the lending bank a day or two to provide that letter I was told I could go to the branch to get proof that the trade in car was paid out But the Tesla representative in Oakville Ontario had refused to accept that stamped document from the branch To make my story short the bad thing about the tesla team is the inconsistency in their communication practices but the ugly part lies within their subconscious motto take it or leave it,1,2024-03-04,0.06164772727272726,-0.8946

Daniel Stapleford,Sound fibonacci and Mandalis,FAO Elon I hope this message finds you well I am writing to express my appreciation for the innovative steps Tesla continues to make within the automotive industry particularly with the design of the new Model 3 Your teams efforts in advancing electric vehicles are truly commendable and contribute significantly to human evolution However I wish to address a particular design choice regarding the new Model 3 that has sparked considerable concern Specifically the decision to replace the iconic simple Tesla logo at the vehicle's rear end with the brand name spelled out While I understand the intent behind brand visibility and recognition this change seems to detract from the elegant simplicity that Tesla is known for I'd like to offer a perspective that considers the broader implications of design elements Sound as you know is a form of vibration and vibrations manifest shapes harmonious sounds create beautiful coherent patterns akin to those found in nature or in the intricate mandalas that symbolise mindfulness and focus in various cultures This principle of harmony and simplicity resonates deeply with the human psyche echoing the elegance found in the natural world By extending this analogy the Tesla logo in its singular form serves not just as a brand identifier but as a symbol that conveys a multitude of meanings and values a testament to innovation quality and sustainability Conversely spreading out the name 'TESLA' into individual letters across the car's rear could be perceived as a regression to a more conventional and less inspired form of expression It suggests a return to the literal when the power of a symbol lies in its ability to evoke a spectrum of ideas and emotions much like the transition from noise to music or from form to essence In essence what I wish to convey is the beauty inherent in simplicity an attribute that Tesla has exemplified across its product lines and brand ethos Reverting to the singular impactful logo could reinforce this principle aligning the visual message with the profound values Tesla represents Thank you for considering this feedback Your work continues to inspire and drive forward not only the automotive industry but also broader discussions on sustainability and the future of technology Warm regards,3,2024-03-02,0.16892393320964746,0.9952

MJ,Tesla is an unregulated entity in UK,Tesla is an unregulated entity in UK They are not registered with the Motor Ombudsman and do not have any code of conduct for customer service They do not have any mechanism to register any complaints They are using the loophole in motoring industry as perhaps the only business not having signed up to regulator So you cannot take your grievance to any regulator The only way to escalate would be to take legal action which in most cases is disproportionately expensive and time consuming If any of you can succeed in even registering a formal complaint with Tesla that would be a great triumph This is all the more important as their customer service is absolutely appalling British consumers should know this before buying Tesla but they don't That is scandalous in my view I discovered all this after experiencing serious customer service issues on several occasions There are much better electric cars out there now with good customer service attached,1,2024-01-26,0.13854166666666667,0.9417

Rizwan Awan,A Rocky Road with My Tesla Model Y,As a new Tesla Model Y owner I embarked on what I hoped would be a seamless journey with a cutting edge electric vehicle However my experience has been anything but smooth marked by a series of unfortunate incidents and what I perceive as inadequate customer service Windshield Woes Within the first month I encountered a mysterious crack in the front windshield Tesla's assessment attributed it to a rock strike an explanation I found perplexing and somewhat unsatisfactory The responsibility for repair costs amounting to approximately 2000 fell entirely on me a disheartening outcome for such a new purchase Tire Troubles on the Road My drive from Redmond WA to Portland OR was abruptly interrupted by a blown tire a stressful situation exacerbated by a blizzard Tesla's roadside assistance was far from comforting their suggestion to book a hotel and wait for service was impractical given the severe weather conditions and my family's well being Although they eventually sent a service truck to replace the tire their insistence on taking the damaged tire to their service center was another point of frustration Compounded by the discovery of a second damaged tire with an additional cost of 420 for replacements the ordeal was a significant inconvenience It disrupted our family routine causing us to miss work and school Comparing Experiences Reflecting on my ownership of cars from other brands like Nissan Toyota and Honda I can't recall facing such issues My decision to switch to Tesla was driven by a desire to embrace environmentally friendly technology and to benefit from the purported long term economical advantages of an electric vehicle However this series of events has led me to question my decision As of now I'm left with the task of coordinating the retrieval of my tire from Portland and addressing the bubble in the second tire which renders my car undriveable It's a reminder that every purchase especially one as significant as a vehicle comes with its own set of challenges In Conclusion This review is a candid account of my experience as a Tesla owner It's not just about the technical difficulties but also about the expectation of support and service that should accompany any high end product I remain hopeful for a resolution and believe that sharing my story might help others in making informed decisions My journey with Tesla continues and I'm eager to see if the coming weeks bring about a change in my current perspective,1,2024-01-25,0.06799120234604106,-0.0784

Tarinder Bhatia,Extremely deceptive dishonest and unsafe company,I recently had my car serviced at Tesla Nottingham and unfortunately I encountered several concerning issues during the process Despite multiple visits and attempts to address the same issue I experienced repeated delays and a lack of effective communication from the service center The recommended replacement of rotors and pads did not resolve the initial problem and I felt frustrated by the lack of a prompt and satisfactory resolution Additionally I found it challenging to get in touch with the service center as my messages were often ignored and there was no available phone number for direct communication This lack of accessibility added to the inconvenience of the overall experience Furthermore I was deeply upset by a past incident where the service provided by the company led to an injury to my daughter This neglectful experience has left me extremely dissatisfied with the level of care and attention to detail from the company's management and staff I hope that by sharing my feedback the company can take steps to improve their service and prioritize effective communication and customer care in the future,1,2024-01-07,0.029761904761904767,-0.8222

JK,Incompetence beyond belief,I recently had an incredibly frustrating experience with Tesla in the UK that compelled me to rethink my decision entirely The incompetence displayed in their communication process is beyond belief First and foremost the finance figures presented on their website did not align with the reality I faced a mysterious increase of 31 per month with zero explanation To add insult to injury the app requested exhaustive part exchange details only to inform me later that I couldn't part exchange my car because I was ordering a contract hire vehicle This lack of coherence left me questioning the entire transaction Attempting to communicate with Tesla over text messages proved almost laughable It felt like a pointless endeavor as I found myself endlessly repeating the same information without any resolution in sight If this is the level of customer service before taking delivery one can only imagine what the aftercare might entail Regrettably my experience has led to a complete loss of confidence in Tesla prompting me to cancel my order My advice to potential buyers think long and hard before diving into a relationship with this brand The pitfalls in communication and discrepancies in financial information are red flags that shouldn't be ignored,1,2023-12-21,-0.06333333333333332,-0.9277

Rob Schulte,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,I love my Tesla but absolute hate the Tesla buying experience and Tesla customer service experience There literally is zero customer service I purchased a 2023 Model 3 which was in itself a very much technology driven experience which wouldn t be bad except that complete removal of the human element leaves one having to rely on unreliable sources to answer questions Currently I have been facing an issue with obtaining the documents I signed at purchase I asked the Tesla delivery person for copies at the time of delivery and was told they had no way to give me copies However I was assured that all of the documents would be uploaded and available via my Tesla account Well they aren't My insurance company is requiring a copy of the NC odometer disclosure statement showing the vehicle was new and the mileage at purchase Of course this document has not been uploaded When I try contacting my local showroom where I purchased the vehicle I get a voicemail saying no one is available to take the call and to leave a message and someone would return my call However the mailbox has been full for quite some time and I have been unable to leave a message When you call the national customer care number it asks for your zip code then routes you right back to your local showroom There is absolutely no customer service whatsoever I replied to the after sale survey and blasted them with very detailed responses of my experience and of course there has been no response to that The online chat is for sales only and the minute you ask about post sale issues the chat representative says they will have someone reach out to you and then they immediately end the chat Of course no one ever actually reaches out It is very sad to see a company with so much potential and such a great product being run in such an abysmal fashion with no care or concern after getting your money This is my first and last Tesla and advise anyone looking at purchasing one to stay away That is unless you simply do not care about customer service,1,2023-12-21,0.02840259740259741,-0.9514
Endre,Severe Critique of Tesla Service Center Ålesund,I regret to express my profound dissatisfaction with the Tesla Service Center in Ålesund Norway an experience that has compelled me to share my grievances in the hope of alerting potential Tesla buyers to the pitfalls they may encounter My interactions with the service center over the past few years have been nothing short of a nightmare On multiple occasions when I entrusted my vehicle to their care for servicing I received it back in a worse condition than when I initially handed it over It is disheartening that a company of Tesla's stature cannot fulfill its commitment to providing reliable and effective service One of the glaring issues I encountered was their blatant disregard for timelines and promises Time and again they made assurances they could not keep leaving me frustrated and disillusioned Their inability to adhere to deadlines not only inconvenienced me but also highlighted a lack of organizational competence Moreover the service center's understanding of technical issues and their subsequent resolution is questionable at best It is alarming that a company at the forefront of technological innovation fails to address fundamental problems within their service operations The repeated instances of returning my vehicle with more issues than initially reported indicate a systemic failure in their approach to quality assurance Equally disappointing is the woefully poor customer service Dealing with the Tesla Service Center in Ålesund has been the worst customer experience I have ever encountered The lack of empathy communication and accountability from their staff exacerbates the frustration and disappointment customers feel when facing issues with their vehicles In light of these experiences I can no longer endorse Tesla as a reliable and customer centric brand I strongly caution prospective buyers to reconsider their plans to invest in a Tesla vehicle The allure of cutting edge technology should not overshadow the fundamental aspects of customer service and reliability that are sorely lacking in my experiences with the Tesla Service Center in Ålesund,1,2023-12-18,-0.11857142857142855,-0.9928

Nate Le,Poor customer service,I recently purchased a Tesla Model Y Performance MYP and while my initial experiences with the car were promising and exciting I've been nothing short of frustrated with the service I received On the night of October 17th I encountered system errors in the Tesla app Unfortunately I didn't think much of it at the time but my world came crashing down the next morning when I tried to get my kids to school and head to work only to discover that my brand new EV had completely shut down I couldn't even open the doors In desperation I contacted Tesla's roadside assistance who promptly towed my car to the service center During that call I was informed that the issue was likely a faulty V12 battery and I was assured that they would quickly replace it allowing me to get back on the road the same day Hopeful I checked in at the service center and was told that there was an isolated event that needed attention and my car would be ready for pickup on October 19th They provided me with a loaner and I thought my woes would be short lived Unfortunately the nightmare had only just begun The next day I received an update informing me that my car was still under diagnostic and the pickup date was rescheduled to October 20th This pattern continued The date was pushed further to October 23rd and as time passed my frustration grew When I asked for details about the issue I was informed that they needed to replace the drive unit which sounded serious Despite my protests and concerns they assured me it would be a quick fix since the car was already partially disassembled and they were awaiting the part's delivery As the week progressed the pickup date kept shifting with no end in sight I was shocked that a company known for its technological prowess couldn't seem to track their part shipments effectively On Friday I received multiple messages detailing the service progress and they promised to have my car ready by 6 pm However my excitement was short lived when I received a call at 6 45 pm informing me that they were working overtime to complete the quality control checks I expressed my frustration explaining that I couldn't just wait around for an indefinite period The person on the phone understood my concerns but suggested I could pick up the car over the weekend or the following week if I was too busy This was frustrating especially as I had already been forced to cancel a road trip due to the limitations of the loaner vehicle which could only cover 200 miles per day Finally I received a text at 7 pm stating that my car was ready and I was provided with contactless pickup instructions However this was marred by the threat that I would be charged for the parking spot for my car and the loaner if I didn't pick up within 24 hours which directly contradicted what I had been told on the phone When I picked up my car on Saturday I was greeted by a dirty interior with shoe marks on the liners and greases on the inside of driver's side door This was a stark contrast to my previous experiences with car services where protective measures were taken to ensure the vehicle's cleanliness Overall the entire experience left me extremely frustrated and dissatisfied My brand new Tesla Model Y Performance was rendered inoperable for a substantial period of time and I was provided with no clear explanation for the issue Additionally the service I received fell well below expectations and it was evident that little care was taken to ensure the customer's satisfaction and the car's cleanliness This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I hope that Tesla can improve their service standards to match the caliber of their products,1,2023-10-30,-0.04473695286195286,-0.5808

William,Great car great charging great service,I love the car and the charging experience and the service has been great I have a 2022 Model Y which from my perspective drives like a sports car It isn't a cushy ride so it's not for everyone The performance however is great This is my third electric car and by far the best as the first two were what I would call first generation vehicles with around 100 miles of range good for regional use only This one is fantastic for road trips I went from scrambling to find CHAdeMO chargers that were not broken and would accept my payment to the amazing ease of backing in plugging in and watching the volts scream in to the battery at rates I'd never seen before No fussing with my phone or a payment method it just starts and works exactly as anyone would wish In California I can attest to plentiful functioning and comfortable charging stops The range at freeway speeds is not as good as the EPA number but it is far better than my previous cars and is really all I want in the seat in one stint anyway that is about three hours I also love the storage capacity of this car There seems to be no end to the places I can stash things and the main cargo area is huge With the back seats folded down it perfectly holds a twin size mattress pad which I've utilized twice to camp out at RV sites on a longer road trip Get the plug adapters for the outlets used at RV sites and you can also get a free full charge overnight Sweet The service has been great although I haven't had major issues to really test that Firstly when I bought it one of the wheel covers disappeared during a drive They came to the house and replaced it for free Then I called about tire rotation They came to the house and did it in the driveway Amazing And I have a narrow cramped driveway Oil changes and tune ups Yeah good riddance to those And with the car leveraging the generator more than the brakes to slow it down even the brake pads seem unlikely to need service What's left Apparently only tires and washer fluid My only gripes would be the occasional discomfort of the ride and the fact that the wheels are wider than the tires Take a glance at most Teslas' wheels on the curb side and you'll see the ugly mess that results from aluminum upon concrete Apart from that though this is by far the best car I've owned at 63 and my experience with Tesla has been great,5,2023-09-21,0.28752572016460903,0.997

Hector Marrero,Horrible Customer Services and Warranty,I purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance 2022 for 70 000 after taxes in June 2022 Unfortunately Tesla recently reduced the price by approximately 15 7 causing my purchase to result in a loss as my car is now worth less than the new price When I attempted to sell the vehicle I received incredibly low offers ranging from 29 000 to 36 000 resulting in a loss of around 50 in just one year This indicates that the car's value will be exceedingly low in the market in the coming years Furthermore the warranty service provided by Tesla is terrible I scheduled an appointment due to a noise in the front but they informed me that it was normal and that the noise started a month ago When I tried to go to another dealer they wanted to charge me 167 because Tesla does not cover unexpected vehicle noises under warranty As a result I am now stuck with a 2022 car with noises that I cannot claim because the warranty does not cover it I suggest waiting for a better EV vehicle with a decent warranty that prioritizes taking care of customers over making money Tesla does not provide loan cars making it impossible to do any kind of DIY mechanic work since they are the only ones controlling the parts After all this I decided to sell the car and stop supporting a company that doesn't support the customer,1,2023-08-29,-0.029226475279106857,0.1696

Sabih Saleem,Urgent Complaint Regarding Malfunction in My Tesla Vehicle,Dear Tesla Customer Support I hope this email finds you well I am writing to express my extreme concern and disappointment regarding a serious malfunction I experienced with my Tesla vehicle Model Y on 08 01 2023 The incident has left me deeply troubled and has raised significant questions about the safety and reliability of your vehicles On the aforementioned date while I was driving my Model Y I noticed an unusual burning smell coming from the vehicle Shortly after the cruise control system began to malfunction erratically leading to a loss of control over the vehicle's speed In a matter of seconds the display and all lights on the dashboard went dark leaving me unable to monitor crucial information such as speed battery level and vehicle warnings Worse yet the electronic power steering suddenly failed causing an immediate stiffening of the steering wheel and making it incredibly difficult to control the vehicle As a result my car veered into a curb causing damage to the wheels and suspension and fire I cannot stress enough how distressing this situation was Not only did it put my safety and the safety of others at risk but it also raises questions about the reliability and effectiveness of the various systems within the vehicle I have always trusted Tesla's commitment to innovation and cutting edge technology but this incident has shattered my confidence in the vehicle's reliability I am writing to urge you to take immediate action to investigate this malfunction thoroughly and provide a comprehensive explanation for what transpired I request a detailed analysis of the root cause of the issue and assurance that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future I have been a loyal Tesla customer for 2 years and until this incident I have been delighted with the exceptional performance and features of your vehicles However this incident has left me deeply concerned and I sincerely hope that Tesla takes my complaint seriously and addresses it promptly I kindly request that you arrange for a thorough inspection and repair of my vehicle to ensure that it is safe to drive Additionally I would appreciate timely updates on the investigation and steps being taken to prevent similar occurrences in other Tesla vehicles Thank you for your attention to this matter I trust that Tesla will uphold its reputation for excellence and take the necessary actions to rectify this situation and ensure the safety of its valued customers Sincerely sabih saleem,2,2023-08-04,0.030208333333333327,0.9972

Brennen Lancashire,Not good customer service,I ve had my model 3 standard plus for 5 months and I must say I absolutely loved how it drives but were it all falls apart in when something goes wrong my rear indicator has stopped working which in any other car would be a minor issue but not the case with a Tesla I took it to my local garage and had their auto electrician look at it he didn t have a clue of what the problem was and gave up so I contacted Tesla through the app and after a couple of days texting with them they finally said they would come out to my house to look at it but they couldn t get to me for nearly two weeks with an estimated cost of 450 which I find totally unbelievably and so if customer service is important to you then I would say don t buy a Tesla as their service is very hit Orr miss I will update once they come out to fix the problem and let you know how it goes,3,2023-05-26,0.04318181818181818,-0.9022

phil,DO NOT GET A TESLA FROM THIS STOKE ON,DO NOT GET A TESLA FROM THIS STOKE ON TRENT DEALERSHIP after purchasing a brand new Tesla Y Performance and driving 2 5 hours to pick up the car Arrived 10 mins early than my scheduled 2 pm slot I asked one of the younger members of the team that I have come to collect my car who informed me the manager would be over shortly 30 mins passed still no manager goes AWOL I saw a car of the same colour and was the performance model in the showroom with people in it and a young child jumping up and down over the seats I said to my mate jokingly I bet that is my car it had mud on the wheels and was in the showroom so I asked a staff member where my car was he informed me out the back and said I would like to inspect it Then he came back and apologized and informed me that the car with muddy wheels and people and kids have been jumping about in it was actually mine So I purchase a car worth over 61k and Tesla cannot be bothered to get this cleaned or removed from public use The manager of the day did not reappear the young guys that have only been at this showroom just over 12 weeks apologized and said he would take it and get it cleaned asap now over 2 hours in and the manager is more interested in trying to sell another car than actually deliver the car to me This is totally shocking again the young guys basically running the showroom were a credit however the manager for the day was an absolute joke it was like being looked after by Mr Bean if he worked for Tesla Still have two scratches in my car which waiting for Tesla services to resolve after sending pictures on Saturday via app and again on Monday to resolve this So maybe it s a case of once sold the car no need to deal with the customer anymore Do not expect a reply as could not even give customer service Oh sorry I forgot about the total lack of customer service was given a cheap plastic umbrella and two tesla mugs and sent on my way No wonder Tesla shares are down with service like this,1,2023-03-29,0.01563552188552189,0.9124
Toby Stone,UK Review Model 3,Model 3 Performance arrived from dealer scratched in multiple places vehicle delivery driver reported this on collection and was told to deliver anyway Pre inspection of vehicles prior to delivery is clearly very poor I am now waiting for a further 2 months for the vehicle to be repaired there's no room for movement on a repair date and Tesla have shown very little interest or care I love the car but really dislike the hands off impersonal approach to resolving issues The technician who visited my home address for initial inspection was pleasant and helpful but the Tesla app for all service issues feels disconnected and it's not even worth attempting to call the service centre Work to be done here as this experience is enough to cause me to look elsewhere when replacing our other car It's currently a BMW and at this point will stay that way,2,2023-03-28,0.06496794871794873,0.6981

Richard,Worst car buying experience of my life,Sad to say that after 6 years owning a Model S with overall excellent experience when buying a new Model Y in the UK it's like a different company Absolutely abysmal system of allocating collection dates where estimated dates bear no resemblance to actual dates offered I have now had to lose allocation of the car twice because I was unable to collect on the appointed day despite in the latest experience paying in full already and insuring the car then finding myself stuck in Europe 3 days longer than expected Tried to delay collection just 3 days and they're not interested Even reallocated my car to someone else 2 days before what was to be my collection day I'm absolutely furious about this ridiculous system and due to estimated dates going forward it now looks like I'll be on holiday cruising Alaska when my next collection week is offered although due to estimated and actual dates being unrelated I am still unable to plan another collection in what will be 2 more months Tesla no longer seem to care about their customer relations and if I could buy this car in another way from somewhere else I would If there was a Zero star rating they would get one from me,1,2023-03-27,0.028901515151515157,-0.7854

Nigel Kellow,I'd rather have root canal treatment,The term master slave is common in tech and engineering vernacular I've heard it's also used in certain social circles that I've seen programmes about on TV but of which I haven't had any personal experience Well that was until I bought a Model Y which I finally picked up last week Let's get one thing clear straight away I've bought an EV for tax purposes That's it Several years ago I bought Priuses but after someone tapped on my window one day and asked me if I could take them somewhere and another occasion when I was parked on the side of the road answering some texts and my rear passenger door opened and a mother and her daughter started to get in I decided to go back to SUVs of the gas guzzling type But recently I've decided to dip my toes again into the environmentally ignore the devastating consequences of mining friendly waters of the EV scene I see so many Teslas around the streets there must be something good about them I thought And the tax breaks are still pretty good And they're the longest range and best value of EV SUVs They're not really SUVs as the IRS has recently said and I have to agree with them I can get my big dog comfortably in the back of any of my previous SUVs but there's no way he'd fit in this thing But let's get onto the buying and handover experience First of all the website wouldn't take a credit card payment so I had to drive miles in my gas guzzling SUV to a Tesla store where the assistant did some website workaround because the website doesn't work properly in order to take my deposit And then I waited With weeks to go I was contacted by the finance company and did all the paperwork All good so far Tesla then bombarded me with multiple emails and texts asking me to complete financial paperwork which I'd already done And then with days to go until the handover Tesla sent me a text asking me to make the initial payment through the website So I went to the website and My car had gone They'd cancelled my order Nothing there Just an invitation to choose which Tesla I wanted to buy Now this was in the evening and you'd think that as a global tech company they'd have global 24 7 service Oh no It's 9 5 Monday to Friday in your own country I mean seriously But we sorted that out during office hours with the finance company not with Tesla and I had a collection date and time I was all excited I love it when you go to pick up a new vehicle and the salesperson who's been looking after you through the process takes you around your beautiful new machine which might have cost you over a hundred thousand whatevers You know how the experience is when you unwrap a new electronic device that's designed in California but built in China and whose name I'd better not mention here in case it gets deleted Well I expected the same with my brand new Tesla Y long range The Tesla showroom at my pick up location is a container in a car parking lot There were three standing tables with assistants standing behind each one and a small table with some gross Tesla branded merchandise including a creepy looking soiled Tesla decanter I mean who on earth in a car company that goes on so much about safety thought that a branded container for alcohol would be a good idea for merch If you haven't seen one Google it They really do exist And now let me describe to you my handover experience I was excited After giving me the black Tesla cards the sales assistant started the handover She pointed to the parking lot and said That's yours over there That was it I'm not tech slouch I've founded and built a tech startup before I'm OK with tech But it was a full 30 minutes before I could figure out how to make this thing move and find the switch to turn off the hazard lights But once I got it going it was actually quite fun to drive But it came with only 44 charge which went down to 28 after driving only 15 miles OK I thought the battery needs to be woken up a bit So I went to try to charge it I tried six different charging points but it wouldn't charge in any of them I spend around 36 hours over this weekend just gone trying to figure out how to charge the thing Eventually I came across an article talking about rebooting So I thought I'd give that a go I rebooted my car Who'd have thought that would be a thing But it seemed like a cool techy idea so I rebooted it and it worked So my brand new car with 15 miles on the clock is now re charging And it's gone from 26 to 71 in just under a day Yep 20 hours Not looking good so far which brings me back to the master slave analogy I can't help but feel like I'm the slave here and my master in California or Texas or wherever is having a laugh at my expense while I have shiny white Model Y lodged up my fundament glacially charging,1,2023-03-07,0.13276286676286675,0.998

Tommy,Tesla mentally and financially hurts me,This drama brand car is a lot more stressful than having a wrong boyfriend girlfriend I was so proud and excited to purchase a pre own 2018 Tesla model S without thinking and doing research carefully I ve experienced issues such as door handle the most common one brake pad screen upgrades I got a used one 34k miles for 70k way overpriced and have driven for about 700 miles door handle got stuck and it painfully cost me 425 to fix my basic warranty expired The major issue started when I reversed it and it made an incredible loud bang sound like metal slammed to metal it was shocking I immediately scheduled service appointment and they stated if they were going to take a look there would be a diagnose fee of couple hundred dollars therefore they only drove it and said my brake was absolutely normal then it happened again I brought it in for another service and again they confirmed nothing was wrong with my car On 1 30 23 my Tesla was completely stuck I couldn t move forward or backward something wrong with the drive unit motor and it strongly stopped my car from moving the tow company wanted 300 to tow it to the service center I didn t want to pay that much and I tried put more pressure on the accelerator to try to move it my car was forcefully bouncing forth and back for 35 seconds and boom that metal collapsed sound happened again I even had my son recorded to show them proof because they had never believed my story I got blamed and excuses for all of the issues The total of 5 unbelievable visits to SC for driving less than 1k miles I treat this tesla like a baby garage kept haven t drove in the rain drive it very gently and routinely charge it Anyway I had to agree to the diagnose fee in order for them to open things up to take a glance Finally they found something wrong with the brake and painfully charged me 800 but not guaranteed if that abnormal sound or car being stuck would happen again and I don t know when it would act up safety concerns I had explained to them multiple times regarding the issues with the recorded video clip for proof and I still got blamed for not using my Tesla properly they suggested me not to let my car sit there for extended period of time I haven t done that it s been driven daily and they also blamed on the phenomenal issue specifically occurred to my Tesla only After reading all negative reviews I strongly believed these reviews are true and honest I have purchased many different brand cars and not a single simple problem occurred whatsoever and even the old one with 200k miles wouldn t hurt me badly like this Tesla S I feel so regret that I couldn t sell it because the price significantly dropped hurting many tesla owners some dealers already stopped buying or taking Tesla for a trade in some offered me dirt cheap low for my Tesla model S I m now stuck with this poor quality car with constant issues and unpredictable ones unexpectedly coming anytime It is a nightmare a disease a stress because it hurts me both mentally and financially Tesla really need to do something seriously about all those complaints and concerns Please treat consumers right stop taking advantage of consumers playing around with people trust and please stop taking people hard work money You guys need to lower the repair maintenance ripped off fees or do something fairly for many bad luck buyers like me never buy anything from Tesla again PLEASE BE AWARE EVERYONE don t let them hurt you hopefully my true story helps something,1,2023-02-05,0.08242622401073105,-0.9808

Sonja Thompson,Follow up on my previous review Tesla,Follow up on my previous review Tesla Service Center Plano Day 9 I finally was notified by e mail that my car was ready for pick up As on previous encounters there was only one person at the reception area desk I was informed car was ready and key was in car I had to ask where the car was located slot number 9 Had to ask where that was the end of this building I had to ask what the problem was with the traction control Was told everything checked out no problems with the wiring or software Told they thought it was the passenger rear tire which did not match the other tires they exchanged it I told them and so they should since that tire was placed by their shop I had a nail in the cars original tire so Tesla replaced it with a Michelin tire the rest of the tires are Pirelli Service person indicated that this tire was not placed by them I had to inform her that indeed it was and gave her the timeline of that replacement After checking her computer she finally acquiesced that was correct Before I left the service center I looked to make sure that the replacement tire was a Pirelli and the size matched the other rear tire The following day I checked the tire pressures and found the replaced tire had 47 psi where the other 3 had 39 40 and 41 psi Why would you have one tire that was so much more inflated Of note when the original tire that had the nail was exchanged the tire pressure on the exchange was also 47psi Owners Manual and screen display indicate tire pressure should be 42 psi front and rear What am I missing Perhaps the sheer incompetence of Plano Tesla Service Center,1,2022-12-17,0.04280303030303031,-0.1134

Brent Bauer,Tesla's idea of customer service is completely unacceptable,Let me start by saying I absolutely love my Tesla Model S It is a great car But if you are considering buying a Tesla I strongly urge you DONT DO IT I say this because Tesla service is possibly the worst I have ever experienced The computer in my car was going out and to fix it Tesla gave me the option of installing a refurbished original system for 750 or a hot new infotainment upgrade for 2000 i went with the upgrade and when I picked up my car was shocked to find the new system did not come with AM FM radio or Siriux XM satellite radio Those are the two primary sources of music for me and what car audio system doesn't have them They took these offerings away but will provide them for a software upgrade costing 500 I tried to reason with Tesla and said I would have gone with the cheaper solution had I known getting AM FM radio I like to listen to sports talk or Sirius XM would cast an extra 500 But they said that a technician sent me a link over the Tesla service app that listed all the features and benefits I told them that taking something away is neither a feature or a benefit I was sold on an upgrade that would fix all my car's problems and taking away my primary music sources is NOT an upgrade Who follows a link and goes to read fine print about an upgrade to make sure things like major music sources aren't being taken away It's like reading fine print to make sure you navigation system or brakes are still there It's supposed to be an UPGRADE They did not see it my way of course and that is a simple illustration of how little Tesla really cares about their service Another major problem with Tesla service is that it is impossible to talk to a live human being They force everything to be done through their app Whenever I have needed service my appointments have been pushed back time and again This last time one of my car's problems was that the wifi system was failing so they couldn't pull diagnostics from it remotely I tried calling them to tell them about my problems but all phone calls circle right back to sending you to their app I don't have problems with technology but sometimes it is infuriating and it almost always is with Tesla Can you imagine not being able to reach a real person no matter how hard you try,1,2022-12-09,0.11330395794681507,0.8854

Gaurav Gupta,I wanted to share you my experience,I wanted to share you my experience today when I went for a Test drive in Fremont 1 I had setup an appt for today evening but did not receive any proper directions I used GPS to land at the factory but finding the test drive center took me forever Neither the directions are not at all clear nor the sign boards are big enough to be noticed2 After a bit of struggle I did make it to the Test Drive center The staff was not at all welcoming me but were totally relucant to give me a tour of the car They pointed me to the car for test drive but direction even to the car was completely ambiguous I landed at the wrong car at first had to go back and forth to the center to finally find my test drive vehicle 3 The staff assumed I knew all the things how to even unlock the car how to start it Yet again I somehow got into the car tried to figure out everything on my own finally realizing that I needed a PIN to start the car which was not provided 4 So another trip back to the center and with pretty rude staff who finally told me the PIN and finally I was able to drive the car5 After test drive I went in to discuss the price etc and once again your rude staff snubbed me stating that I can buy everything onlineThe staff was totally busy on their phones not sure if it was work related and not at all friendlyI was expecting much more professional behavior but sadly to say today's experience was far from it Hope this helps in making some improvements in customer service at your center in one of the most admired technology companies,1,2022-10-29,0.023437500000000003,-0.8604
Sam Dias,Is this the type of management that a corporation like TESLA allows on their facilities,Review IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY IT IS A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE Tesla's Fort Lauderdale retail service location ignored our presence at their show room this past Monday There were 4 Sales Advisors behind a desk to the left of the glass door to the showroom All four were busy looking at pc and or iPad screens and none of them acknowledged our presence for about 5 to 7 minutes of us standing about eight feet from them Then one whose name we will not motion here who in the end was polite asked what he could do for us We explained that when we got delivery of our second Model S we were not given the second key fob standardly provided on delivery at that time to any Model S new owner We explained that we had called Customer service and that a representative said that a note would be placed on our account allowing the service to provide the free key fob As he could not find the note he said that he would text that person internally to confirm Upon leaving the dealership as asked by that Sales Advisor we called Customer Service back and spoke with a person who happened to have the same name as the one we had spoken to that morning She saw no notes on the account but assured us she would not only type them in but contact via text that Advisor we had just spoken with Well last night I received a message from that Advisor in which he said they would not do that because he could not see any authorization on that and that his Management did not want to provide the replacement key fob for free as the too much time had passed since we purchased the Model S Principal We have been a long time loyal Tesla owner since 2016 with the plans to exchange our owned Model S for a Plaid Model in the first QT of 2023 The extremely poor and unthought out decision by the Fort Lauderdale Manager as we were told is so unfortunate It is not business oriented at all that a Tesla Dealership Manager would not provide his customer with a free key fob which at cost for Tesla would represent less than 0 04 of the price of the car we intend to buy Well the price that they would charge of 217 75 is not the question here but what does matters is the fact is that we were not provided with the second fob at delivery of our brand new Tesla Model S at that time therefore we should not be incurring in this expense at all It is a question of principle not money For a long time we have been noticing that Tesla is declining their customer service as originally experienced by us in 2016 It was awesome until we believe 2018 Since them we waited at times almost one hour on the phone to get a representative over the phone and we were treated with disrespect at least two times at the North Lauderdale Service Retail branch At a time in which serious competition not too much for the model S is knocking on Tesla's doors day by day louder and louder it does become crucially important that Tesla pays attention and moves their service to one of the utmost Excellence We would like the Management at Fort Lauderdale to be aware of what they are doing in terms of customer service both on the retail and on the service side On our last visit the speakers were blasting with rock music so loud that the service representative behind the counter needed to scream at him so that we could understand him and vice versa The service center looked disorganized and very confusing On top of that we were ignored also by one of the persons on the second roll of counters which was a female She never acknowledged our presence as well This is unacceptable We would like to get this situation resolved and obtain the key fob which was never provided to us at delivery by the Dania Beach location they were awesome to us on any encounter Too bad that they are now closed,1,2022-10-29,0.05032776747062462,0.9755

Clive Seddon,Warning for Manchester Stockport,Warning for Manchester Stockport service customers I Love my 2018 model S Had a slight nocking noise from behind the dash while in warranty Aug this year The first all day booking didn't sort it as they said they needed to escalate to 'engineering' to pinpoint remotely using a sound recording The second booking did fix it by changing both front air suspensions and other bits but they left my steering wheel wonky when driving straight To sort they say I need to rebook another service which I did but I insisted on a loan car which they agree to in the messages on the app I got a message closer to the booking stating a strict contactless drop off I reply wanting to confirming the loan car pickup to which they said they didn't have one available I tried to resolve in messages within the app but they closed the booking saying I needed to start the process again I now can't book anything in the App with Manchester Stockport as it just keeps saying 'try again' The App doesn't help diffuse frustration as the replies are generally rude impersonal and provides no continuity with the ongoing issue Being cut off mid problem is simply unacceptable I feel they have now had 3 chances to fix my issue under warranty although they have fixed some and created another Fed up with the Tesla arrogance and not sure what to do with the car now Its not the car its the service quality and then the App that compounds any issues complication If it was a conversation on the phone I bet it would all be ok and dealt with by now,1,2022-10-22,0.03201754385964913,-0.9451

Alan Spittle,Great car terrible service,To say Tesla is bad at customer service is an understatement if I could have given them 0 stars I would Most of the models in their range are considered by most to be prestige cars or at least this is reflected in the price tag I bought a Model S about three and a half years ago for nearly 95k which compares to previous cars I ve bought from Mercedes and Audi Since then I have been impressed by the capabilities and technology of the car whilst at the same time irritated by the build quality and customer service The latest issue has been with the windscreen washer pump which has already been changed once about a year after I got the car This in itself isn t an issue to me things go wrong its how they are dealt with that is the problem I raised the service incident a few days after I noticed it had stopped working again however it was about a week before a ranger could come out to fix it again not an issue The problem comes because I have gone over 50k mileage whilst waiting for it to be fixed therefore making it not covered by the warranty The ranger tried to fix the issue but failed and I was asked to attend the Tesla Service Centre in Stratford upon Avon I told them that I believed that the repair should be covered by the warranty and didn t accept the quote for the work When I took my car today I once again explain and told them I wasn t happy they said they would have a look into it When they had finished they told me they had fixed it and I needed to pay 135 This is for a pump which you can buy on the internet for about 5 To actually get my car back I had to pay this no amount of complaining could change their stance Insult to injury when I got my car back there was a tire pressure warning I hadn t even driven away When I went back in they told me it was already on when they got the car this isn t true and I asked them to check the car's logs to see this which they declined I said if it was on why didn t they mention this as a good customer service representative would Their attitude was well tough I m yet to see if there is any damage to the tire and if there is I will be pursuing it legally just because their attitude stinks I ve owned several Mercedes and there is no comparison I won t buy another Tesla purely because of their customer service,1,2022-09-08,0.05711346266901824,-0.9393

Rob H,Tesla after sales is worse than appalling,I have a 2019 tesla X 100D purchase price c 117000 00I don't usually revert to complaining like this but anybody reading please be aware The Tesla after sales is worse than appalling and I can't begin to express my frustration enoughI have been lucky enough to have owned some amazing high end vehicles including Aston Martin DB9 Maserati Gran Cabriolet Ferrari 575M Marinello Still got it and Audi RS6Im not bragging as I know how lucky I have been to experience some awesome cars and have had dealings with after sales teams looking after expensive vehiclesI decided to go for the X as I felt it was time to go electric and it seemed to fit the billThe model X 300 mile range only ever charges to 257 miles but thats not the issueDue to the shabby build quality the car has been into the Tesla Service Centre SC on a number of occasions I have now been waiting months to have the faulty suspension fixed and at every point of contact with either the Tesla telephone support team or through the APP have been met with total BS empty promises incompetence and failure to get the simplest of things in place providing the merest hint of customer satisfaction I had to use the car to go to Devon and the Tesla team told me that if I had an issue on the trip to call roadside assistance GET THISAfter protracted 'negotiation' I eventually was able to accept an appointment made by the telephone support team to have my vehicle fixedSince then months due to lack of parts or some other excuses my appointments have been cancelled time and time again the day before the appointment with no resolution in siteI can wait to get the issues fixed and get rid if this skipI would advise anyone thinking of buying a Tesla to just think about and revue against the competition Build qualityThe guys and customers at our local BMW garage were laughing at how mismatched the panels are One of their customers who also had a model S said 'remember it's a Tesla' After sales serviceYou can only go to Tesla for after sales who have a limited SC coverage and believe me they know it Don't count on getting anything done fast or to your satisfaction If you are used to good customer service and decide to buy a Tesla please manage your expectations and be prepared to enter a world of pain As mentioned I can't wait to get the faults sorted with this vehicle and get rid of it ASAP Anyone want a Tesla SO TO CONTINUEThe very next day after posting this review Tesla called me to advise that all parts were in and the job can be completed The guy asked me what they could do to help ease the situation as he had read all of the logs and could understand my frustrationIt is agreed that Tesla will collect my car on 07th Sept leave a loaner fix my car and bring it back to collect their loanerIm not holding my breath as I am fully expecting a note delaying the appointment on the 06th or a denial of the agreement I couldn't make it up Lets seeModel X still for sale at some time in the future Conclusion The vehicle was collected a day earlyNot an issue as I was happy to get ridAfter a couple of days I was asked if it was OK to carry our a factory reset to clear all GPS locations and eradicate the weird raising and lowering issue I agreedThe SC contacted me asking when I would like to collect the vehicle I refused as the deal was that they would deliver it back to meThey did the next dayThe representative was informative by explaining what had been done to rectify all of my issuesThe cost would have been if not under warranty way over 2000 00So since I have owned the vehicle a 2019 over 3000 00 worth of parts and labour have been allocated to itOn the first outing the suspension raised unexpectedly and I called the rep as the factory reset obviously did not resolve the issueFortunately there was a quick fix and I have now switched off the auto raise and lowerThe rep also advised me to drive always in the normal setting as anything else will cause wear to the inside or outside of the tyresNow I have a Tesla that works and for some freak reason my battery full charge capacity has increased from a max of 252 miles to 261 Looking at and testing alternative EV offers I can't find anything that delivers better range and software than the X that I have so will keep this vehicle until the warranty is up then its outThe issue with Tesla is the the build quality is not able to compete with its European rivals and due to a lack of spare parts and staff after sale support is appallingLets hope it all improves for Tesla in the future as I would not wish my experience upon most people,1,2022-10-06,0.11093809523809522,0.9934

Robert Thayer,Nothing but service and reliability nightmares,We own a 2020 Model Y First the door and hood panels didn't mesh properly and we took it in for service in Rocklin CA in 2020 They tried to fix it with a ball peen hammer and left the hammer in the car We complained and took the car in again Tesla sent us to a third party body shop under warranty to fix the misaligned doors and rear hatch Next the rear hatch failed to open and close and Tesla sent us to another body shop under warranty to get that fixed Then we hit a pothole at night in Tahoe City CA in winter of '21 and got a pinch flat caused by the stock tire on our 20 rims cutting a two inch gash in the sidewall No spare of course Tesla roadside service was useless and we waited in the car at night from 7 30 to 11 p m We paid to have the car towed to Sacramento Tesla and had to hassle them to get a new tire not in stock after waiting several days Recently a small plastic piece on the end of a bungee cord got caught in between the glass sunroof and glass hatch window when the window was up When I pressed the button to lower the rear hatch the glass in the hatch shattered and the sunroof corner fractured 2 900 dollars estimate by Tesla who said they would only accept their insurance not ours we would have to pay up front and they made an appointment to fix both sunroof and hatch glass Night before they called and said the glass would not be in for another 8 days minimum Does this sound like a reliable car and good service to you This will be our first and last Tesla Please don't buy one,1,2022-08-04,0.012445887445887456,-0.6369
Jackie Osland,Worst service in the industry,I love the car but the service has got to be the worst in the business There is no one you can call to ask a question about service You have to do everything thru their app and it is not that easy to navigate For instance if you need new tires which other shops are hesitant to work on a Tesla it is not easy to communicate that to the service department I have scheduled and service and then they have just cancelled it without explanation I have taken my car there with low tire pressure and they have messaged me it is done but I can t tell if they fixed the tire You don t know if they are going to keep your car overnite as there is NO ONE who is going to talk to you or message you an estimate of how long the service will take And then when the car is done they leave it in the lot and try not to talk to you again by leaving the check out to the app They sure save money on staffing but the customer service is absolutely non existent Worst service considering price of car and worst service in the industry period,1,2022-08-03,-0.11707459207459207,-0.9863

Michael Davern,Tesla where the customer is always the loser,Tesla where the customer is always the loser Having purchased what is considered a premium product one would expect any issue s which arose would be dealt with in a professinal manner by the manufacturer Teslas policies with regards to Customer Service seem designed to ensure that when there is an issue the customer is the last party to give consideration to Their Customer Care commitment to providing the best possible experience as stated on their website seems like a mockery of the customer when you are the customer having to deal with them For the purposes of this review I will only detail the vehicles present issue but there have been several others since its purchase in March 2021 My Model 3 recently informed me via an on screen message and just as we were leaving for the airport that the 12volt battery needed to be replaced and that the car was shutting down Please contact Tesla to arrange a service What on what is considered to be most advanced vehicle from a technology point of view it couldn't be programmed to tell us the battery needed replacing before it decides to shut down Thankfully we were at home and not several hundred miles away However that said all vehicles have issues so I would forgive that issue and I contacted Tesla They retrieved the vehicle a couple days later pulling the vehicle with locked wheels on to the flat bed truck a direct contravention of how it should be done according to the Tesla manual According to Tesla Service on mentioning this yeah seen it done before not an issue Why bother putting it in the manual then I had asked for a car to replace my vehicle as the repair is a warranty issue I was advised that a rental vehicle was hired for me some 30 miles away from my home and I could pick it up there No issue send a taxi and I will go get it No how I get there is not a Tesla concern I could not avail of the rental without losing a day from work and then would need to return the rental three days later more lost time and then undertake another journey to Tesla Ireland to pick up a loaner Tesla Ireland in Dublin is based 120 miles away Again I could not avail of this without considerable time lost two days between collection and drop back and considerable expense by way of trains and taxis These issues were not a concern for Tesla On this point of lost time and costs My annual savings over a combustion engine car are approximately 4000 euros To date as self employed people my wife and I have lost 4 6 days on returns outside of the present issue to the Tesla garage in Dublin Any savings on fuel are clearly lost at this stage and the loss of earnings considerable To others like an employee who buys a Tesla as a private vehicle days lost are either unpaid leave or holiday time lost A high price to pay for Tesla ownership To date some eight days since collection of my Tesla I have received one Tesla app message telling me that they do not have a technician to look at the car and it will be looked at when one becomes available and one telephone call prior to that message telling me that the car was undergoing diagnostic checks at present Based on past experiences I know which message I'd believe I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing a Tesla not to see this review or the reviews of others here as the rantings of cranks You will have car issues and you will be treated in the same shoddy manner by Tesla I have been given better after sales service by second hand car dealers on car purchases costing less than 5000 Car collected replacement vehicle delivered to my place of work and my car dropped back after repair Customer service ensuring the customers needs are met The car a delight to drive and ownership a horror but thats purely as a result of having to deal with Tesla Would I buy another one Yes if it was made by Volkswagon or Ford,1,2022-08-02,0.07491045991045994,0.9667

Travis Jack,Worst car experience of my life,Words are not enough to describe the sheer amount of incompetence and lack of consideration from employees of this company I purchased a 2022 Model X which was delivered in late February 2022 Upon delivery I noticed some small issues with the car curbed wheel falcon wing door error when closing etc The wheel was replaced and the dealer said they couldn't recreate the falcon wing issue 2 weeks after that I had the vehicle wrapped in clear paint protection film In April the vehicle's security module failed which made the car unable to open or power on The vehicle was towed to Tesla in Raleigh and sat there for around 10 days waiting on the part and eventual repair Between then and June I had several more issues a piece of wheel trim literally fell off for no reason trim on the bottom of the vehicle on the passenger side was falling off falcon wing door issue was still present one of the rear seatbelts had the buckle installed backwards so the belt had to be twisted to be buckled received intermittent safety restraint failure issues and my keys occasionally would stop working I dropped the car off on Sunday night July 10th for a 8 15 am July 11th service appointment By noon on July 11th I had not heard from anyone and checked my Tesla app to see that the car had not been accessed or moved After several texts via the app they told me they didn't realize my car was there and would start the repairs soon At 3pm they told me they couldn't access the car and needed the keys my wife dropped the keys off around 3 30 and a short time later I was told the service would be performed on July 12th and car would be ready by the end of the day On July 12th I realized I had not received any communication from them and at 3 00 I checked the app and the car still had not been accessed or moved They then informed me that they were having trouble accessing the car and would likely need it until Friday July 15th They did not provide a loaner and were unable to get me a rental car so I was without a car this whole period with only 100 day in uber credits July 15th came and went with no communication and I noticed the estimated repair date was shifted to the following Monday The following Monday they shifted the ETA to Friday Friday they told me the car should be repaired by this Monday July 25th The security module had failed a second time along with all of the other repairs On July 26th I got a message that the car was ready and that due to the module replacement I would have to repair my keys with the car I texted them and asked where the keys would be located as I was picking up after hours and was told I would need to make an appointment to have my keys re paired with the vehicle and they needed at least 72 hours notice So because of a faulty part that had to be replaced which un paired my keys I now have to make another appointment at the service center just to get my key fobs repaired back with the vehicle I was also told that the falcon wing door issue is being caused by the paint protection film and will not be addressed under warranty I have tried on 3 4 different occasions to call them and left voicemails each time with no returned calls I loved the car but after this experience I have sold the car and went back to Range Rover I would strongly advise against buying a Tesla until they get their build quality issues under control and are able to hire competent staff,1,2022-07-27,-0.021544715447154465,0.0991
Naren Gupta,Poor quality meets poor service This is a non luxury technology,I ve had a Tesla model X for five years I ve watched the customer service deteriorate from luxury car standards befitting a six figure purchase to a standard worse than what I remember my Honda dealer gave me The build quality has always been poor the saving grace was with less moving parts there was less to go bad Over time engineering defects came to light with structural components of the car unable to bear the increased torque and acceleration the car was famous for Unfortunately as the car has deteriorated with stock bin components rusting a huge expansion in ownership of lower cost models meant that the profit margin has decreased pressure on employees has increased and the service quality has dropped precipitously Now everybody is being treated like they have bought an entry level car and should be grateful to have a Tesla at all Frankly at this point I dread dealing with service issues through their God awful app and found going to the dealership only a marginally better way of communicating the car s service needs and minimizing the impact of losing my mode of transport When I mentioned this to the beleaguered service advisor at my local Tesla service station his reply was We have too many customers coming in per day There is no comparison between Tesla today and 5 years ago At this point instead of being customer oriented Tesla employees attitude is take it or leave it As soon as there is another car offering similar technology with better quality and service trust me I will take that,1,2022-07-27,-0.07543859649122805,-0.3246

Geoff de Moll,Stay away from Tesla Birmingham,The Tesla Y car is the most magnificent car on the road If you ask me should I buy it I would categorically tell you not to because the service is the worst I ve ever come across they have absolutely no customer service what so ever I ve recently been able to get in touch with the senior manager who has gone through all the issues I have had with the delivery when I was left in doors all day with then knowing that they could not deliver within a reasonable time because someone was off with Covid but they could not be bothered all them to contact me and just left me losing a days holiday from work When I phoned up to find out what was going on I was told there was a problem with the communications which is scandalous as this company send people into space I have millions of satellites but could not pick up the phone The guy on the phone who took 45 minutes to answer also preferred to lie to me where the delivery van was and what I ve gone on during the day When I went to the show room for some help the guy at the show room was so rude in hindsight I wish to punch his lights out They have now looked into the matter and say they re going to do something about it but with there form I don t believe a word they say They have also completely refused to offer me any compensation for all the time I ve spent on this matter not even a gesture of goodwill but apparently it s worth a 45 Tesla voucher As I said the car is wonderful but I d like to return mine because if this is the level of service on delivery I hate to see what happens during the next three years I have the vehicle I ve asked for details of the chief executives email address which I totally refused but I will get in contact with the owner Elon Musk because he needs to know how awful he Starfall to customers that spending 70 000 pounds I can t do it again When I mentioned to the rep who had ignored three emails from me that you have so many negative reviews he said that s cause we sell a lot of cars that s not the truth the truth is you realise on the product and couldn t give a cat in hells about the after service which will come back and bite you on the bum He would be unemployed if he worked for me,1,2022-05-04,0.023809523809523808,-0.9633

Phillip,Customer Service is non existent,I purchased my Tesla Model S in 2015 and before the Pandemic I was putting over 20K miles year on the car It's fun to drive However Tesla as a company to deal with horrible I paid over 100K for my car and received better customer service when I had a 20K Honda In 2019 Tesla pushed out an over the air update which reduced the charge range of my car The equivalent of shrinking my gas tank There was no communication and at first they denied anything if you could contact a human being Well this past week I received my notice of settlement of the Class Action and will receive a whopping 625 Mind you this update caused me extra on road charging time when I was commuting weekly between Northern and Southern California So what next you ask My monitor died the brains of the car The replacement was going to take over a month to receive so I agreed to buy a refurbished monitor which did save me a few hundred dollars A week later I learned there was a recall and my car was eligible for reimbursement I filed the warranty claim for reimbursement over 1 300 and the online screen confirmed eligibility That was 2 years ago I have tried several times to contact someone who can help and have spent close to 10 hours trying to get this resolved I thought I finally found someone at the local location who tried to assist in navigating but they seemed to have also thrown up their hands I guess it'll come down to filing a lawsuit In summary I enjoy driving the car it's comfortable and fun to drive but I don't know if the aggravation in dealing with a company that doesn't understand customer service is worth it,2,2022-04-12,0.056565656565656576,0.9503

Carlos Segura,Think twice when buying used Tesla,I bought my 2013 Model S from its 2nd owner at 98k miles after lots of research reaffirming that maintenance cost was low and reliability was high I actually loved my car drove smoothly and quietly but then I didn t even reached 120k miles on it when the high voltage battery completely died on me I parked one day at work with 80 charge and got out from work to find the battery completely drained to the point of not even starting or being able to put into neutral to push it to a charging stall I left the car plugged in using 3 extension cords for the entire weekend still at my job s parking lot and it didn t take any charge at all and never turned back on again I towed it to the nearest Tesla service center and after over a week they told me the battery had completely died and it needed full replacement to the tune of 23k the car s average value in the best condition possible and long range trim is 26k I asked about warranty coverage and they told me I was out over 100k miles and just at the 8 year mark I asked hypothetically if I had the money for the repair what their warranty would be and they said 50k miles on the battery only The message is DON T BUY USED TESLAS but if you do make sure you re still within the warranty period GET RID OF THE CAR BEFORE THE FACTORY WARRANTY EXPIRES after that all bets are off it may very well become a bottomless money pit DON T EVER BUY A TESLA WITH NEW BATTERY thinking that it s like buying a new car it isn t you re only covered for 50k miles on a fresh battery completely wasteful and senseless It s a great fun and classy car while the warranty lasts service is great and at no cost for warranty covered items no questions asked But once out of warranty you re all on your own They wouldn t even buy it back from me for parts terrible customer service when things went south that leaves much to be desired from such reputable brand,1,2022-03-29,0.178018648018648,0.9664

Amy Lindahl,Telsa service is so frustrating and bad Don't buy anything from them,I'm writing about Telsa solar panel customer service I'm just mad and want to review them somewhere Solar City was my original company bought by Tesla insert throw up emoji Since then every requirement for Tesla customer service fills me with DREAD Why Two years ago at Telsa's direction they said it would be nearly a year before their techs were available and everyone uses their local roofers for the work I paid lots of money to have a roofing company remove and reinstall my panels when I needed a new roof When they couldn't figure out how to reinstall all they had were the original install diagrams sent many times to me by Tesla and MANY calls to Telsa giving me the same guidance I finally pulled the speak to a manager BS got a local Tesla panel installer on the phone and found out roofers should NEVER have uninstalled the panels and would not have the new hardware to needed to reinstall He was shocked that customer service just kept sending my installation plans and thought a non specialist could do this Also I paid for everything twice Did Tesla care No They told me I was getting a deal and it was usually twice the cost to reinstall Great almost 2 000 and over a month of my panels sitting useless in my garage Cut to today I get a text that my system is no longer working and needs to be repaired The only directions are to schedule service via the Telsa app the website is not an option why I download it and log in except whoops it doesn't work and just kicks me to the login screen I reset my password Twice Same glitch I find a service number call wait the call is dropped I call back and wait again Somehow I talk to someone nice and she takes on the repair scheduling herself Only one option but my six hour repair window in a few weeks is scheduled I'm lucky to have the date and I believe her sounds like I got a canceled spot I just want to say Telsa the brand has this gloss this high tech wonderland image The reality is their customer support is HELL Their app doesn't work how does that fit their brand image Their systems are beyond buggy and seem completely untested before they launch with customers Their customer support specialists are often given the wrong guidance and provide you with expensive incorrect information see roofing story And while I bought an electric car recently not for ONE SECOND did I consider a Telsa Was a shocked today to find endless reviews saying people couldn't get help couldn't schedule car repairs Of course not Oh I also noticed that their bad customer service reviews seem buried under fake crap AKA I guarantee they pay for this and want new customers to see 4 star customers ratings the first time they want to learn about Tesla customer service experiences Newsflash the actual rating should be around the Comcast level 1 5 ish on a good day This brand is about flash ego and gives me con vibes Cool car bro hope you like waiting on hold AVOID Telsa,1,2021-11-18,0.006156688839615672,-0.2852

ppr,Tesla Service is extremely poor,This is an email I sent to a Mr Walker who I found on a search is VP Sales Email was returned no such person or email address No one at Tesla has any idea of any email addresses of their top executives Guess that sums it up for Tesla If the Brass don't hear of problem I guess they don't existMr Walker et al for the past year or so I have been exploring the purchase of an Electric Vehicle and finally decided on the new Model S Can't tell you how excited I was when I received an email telling me it had arrived I scheduled delivery for Tuesday August 31 and confirmed delivery on Monday August 30 so I sold my Lexus ES 300h on that Monday Well that excitement went quickly down the tubes as I was informed Monday right after I sold my Lexus the Tesla Model S had a battery issue that needed to be fixed Since I had just sold my Lexus I asked for a loaner car since the timeframe for the fix for the battery issue was unknown Well coming from Lexus I thought I would get the same type of EXCELLENT customer service from Tesla Well was I ever wrong I was told very firmly I must add that Tesla could not would not provide a loaner car as they don't have any And only after insisting something be done I was offered the option of using Uber to get to fro and Tesla would pay the costs Seriously Call an Uber One to get where I need to go and another to get me back home for each and every trip For an unknown period of time After repeated calls to many different Tesla employees I finally got Daniel Monez who offered me a Rental car that Tesla would pay for Took 2 5 days without transportation to get this far Finally They agreed to get me an Enterprise rental car Well to my surprise Enterprise had no cars available and nothing in the near future You think I was a bit upset at this Answer is YESI'll shorten this up a bit Tuesday Car not ready Wednesday car not ready Thursday Tech working on the car called in sick so car not ready Friday September 3 car not ready with no end in sight Still haven't got a rental either Now it's Tuesday September 7 and still no car no rental no nothing I do not want a car that requires the work that needs to be done I understand this is a totally new design with newer hardware and software and I do want it fixed properly not just fast But not providing me with a vehicle and making this seem like it is MY problem and not yours is totally unacceptable Lexus would have bent over backwards to accommodate my request for a LOANER car of the same or similar quality and style without me asking Tesla has chosen to make the customer beg for three days then make a reservation without confirming the availability of any rental cars As you can see my first experience with Tesla Service is well below expected for the price of the car And oh by the way you had no problem requiring FULL payment prior to delivery and no one has yet to offer any compensation for the inconveniences placed on me by your company I find that to be unacceptable as well Would you want to be treated in this manner after spending 100K for a car Do you find this acceptable Are you happy with your Service policy of not providing transportation to customers Or by making the customer feel this is your standard operating practice I hope the answers to these questions are NO NO NO NO I also hope that once I receive my car I will enjoy it and feel it has been worth the fight One can dream I truly hope and expect a response to this email by someone with authority to fix this NO RESPONSE WAS EVER RECEIVED NO ONE AT TESLA CARES ONCE THEY GET YOUR MONEY,1,2021-09-07,0.0748992969205735,0.9856
