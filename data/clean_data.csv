Jonathan Birge,Worst car buying experience I've ever,Worst car buying experience I've ever had They try to automate everything but if one thing goes wrong you have no way to talk to a human They just tell you to go to the app but nobody answers the messages there It's like trying to buy a car from a really apathetic robot I tried to take deliver of my car today and ended up wasting half my day and came home with the same car I drove there with Add to that the fact that you have to drive a long distance to get to one of their dealerships and it's just infuriating they don't have better customer service and have such a cheap bush league purchasing experience,1,2024-11-26
Adam,Disappointing Experience with Tesla,Disappointing Experience with TeslaI have been thoroughly disappointed with Tesla s customer service and overall approach Their lack of response to issues is shocking getting in touch with someone who can actually help is nearly impossible and when you do they are extremely unhelpful Tesla also seems to raise prices whenever they wish with no regard for customers who have already placed orders or those who have been long term supporters of the brand This unpredictability makes it very difficult to trust or plan around their pricing To make matters worse Tesla is not regulated in the UK meaning there is no ombudsman or independent body to hold them accountable for their actions This leaves customers with little recourse when things go wrong For a company that claims to lead in innovation and customer experience they have a long way to go in terms of transparency accountability and support I cannot recommend Tesla based on my experience Their approach feels dismissive and unreliable which is not what you expect when purchasing a premium product,1,2024-11-25
Angry from Manchester,5 5 for the car 0 5 for the dealer,The car model 3 is excellent though feels a little cheap compared to ICE cars of a similar price It's enormous fun to drive and autopilot is awesome The after sales care is shocking They deny legal obligations to fix things and the warranty period is less than a Dacia which is surprising on a 50k car The things that go wrong are mostly niggles But you do need the warranty I think it would be better if they didn't pretend to have a dealer network for all the good they do I was expecting a proper company that stands behind their product That's not what you get,3,2024-11-18

Andrew Haworth,Put a deposit on a cybertruck 4 years,Put a deposit on a cybertruck 4 years ago For the last 2 years I've been trying to contact Tesla for a refund but they never answer the phone When you login to your online account the option manage order takes you to a black screen with a message telling you to contact them on a telephone number I've been trying to contact them for 2 years and finally got through to them today after waiting over 20 minutes on the phone Let's hope that refund arrives cos I don't want to wait another 2 years to get through to someone It took 2 years cos sometimes I ran out of waiting time because I have a job to attend to and a family to look after and the waiting time has usually been longer than it was today Don't touch Tesla with a barge pole Hate to think how long it takes to get hold of them when something goes wrong with the car and I've heard rumours that things often go wrong with them,1,2024-11-20

James Cudd,Tesla UK Attempting to Return Car After Diagnosed Steering Failure,My leased Tesla experienced a complete steering failure while driving on October 19th nearly causing an accident The steering fully locked up while the car was in motion and couldn't be 'unlocked' until the car was turned off and on again What's happened since has revealed deeply concerning practices around Tesla's safety protocols and customer service The most alarming aspect is this Tesla's own remote diagnostic system identified a steering rack fault with the car displaying a limited steering may apply warning Yet after two physical inspections they've claimed they couldn't replicate the fault and have twice attempted to return the vehicle without any repairs They even suggested that it might be a 'one off' and if it happens again to undertake a reset on the steering wheel What if 'it happens again' while driving on a motorway They're now threatening 40 day storage fees for my refusal to collect a car that their own systems flagged as having a steering issue This fundamental contradiction between their remote diagnostics and physical inspections remains completely unexplained How can a car that Tesla's own systems identified as having a fault suddenly be deemed safe for the road without any repairs This raises serious questions about their safety protocols and diagnostic procedures Their customer service response has been equally concerning Safety critical issues appear to either fall outside their staff's training capabilities or worse aren't treated with the gravity they deserve Responses have been limited to a generic templated email with no evidence that anyone understands the serious safety implications of returning a vehicle to the road after a diagnosed steering fault The DVSA is now investigating this safety issue For a premium brand marketing itself on technology and safety Tesla's handling of this situation suggests a worrying disconnect between their diagnostic systems repair protocols and customer safety Potential customers should carefully consider whether Tesla has the proper infrastructure and processes to handle serious technical faults before purchase I am still waiting for a response from them,1,2024-11-22
Michael Mullally,Terrible service,Great car AWFUL customer service The car showed delivery in September when I bought it Then every day the 10 day delivery window moved back 1 day Tesla only has email no phone number Email after email after email no response Eventually they get back to me and tell me the delay is because of the silver wheels and I can get the car within the week if I went with black Would have been really helpful if they'd told me that weeks earlier rather than ignoring my communications They finally give me a delivery date November 1 The same day I move in to a new house the main reason I bought the car and desperately needed the car for that move Now I've had to spend 4000dkk on a rental car for the move And still no responses from Tesla even though they promised to get back to me about compensation Really really bad customer support I choose to lease as I wanted to buy once the new model Y comes out Now I'll never buy a Tesla based on the terrible service and the staff that just don't care,1,2024-11-11

Radu Samson,An honest review of a Tesla Model Y LR '23,Considering they're censoring all honest reviews wherever and whenever they can may this be the only place where one can voice the true value of this vehicle In short everything and more of what you hear is true I've had my Tesla model Y LR for a year now driven more than 30000km in all sorts of conditions countries and places A quick summary the interior space is free of annoying buttons and quite comfortable the ability to control everything via the Tesla app get in and out preheat cool the car and share the key with whomever acceleration it's now a given for all electric cars but still fun tesla charging network saves you a few minutes on each charge but most companies are now adapting Autopilot is a dangerous joke it's jerky it tries to kill you on the highway and is in most cases out of service because one or more cameras are dirty Windshield wipers Never in my adult life have I stepped into a car where having to fidget with the wipers has been more needed in auto mode they'd try and swipe off the light at a traffic light anything but what they're supposed to It's clear whoever engineered them hasn't accounted for rain in their calculations Lights this is where the other drivers should form some sort of union against being blinded by our tesla's the light pattern scatters everywhere but where it's supposed to Paint in short there's more and better quality on my toaster You'll see it right away but there's not much you can do about it value loss bought the car the very last days of December they discounted it by 40000DKK in January no message or offer to compensate Should've prolly just returned it considering the 2 weeks consumer rights thing Parking aid just as autopilot only trust it if you wanna spend your money fixing the car the 3D projection is often off and doesn't account for smaller obstacles as most of the pillars poles or other things you find in parking lots the only thing you can use are the cameras gaps it looks like a lego car when you really look into it noise insulation is pretty much non existent you'll be very connected to your surroundings Drive over long distances it can be really stressful and tiring for your foot considering you can't and SHOULD NEVER rely on autopilot a few trips on the autobahn taught me that the hard way I hear noises soon enough you start walking the fine line between paranoia and schizophrenia as squeaks start forming around the car A C heating as you start the system especially the AC during summer you'll hear something comparable to someone taking a can opener and trying to can open your hood a metal on metal scratch that Tesla Service considers according to specs all normal oh and you can't really turn off the air for your passenger you can only redirect it The overall feeling after 1 year of ownership is that I bought into a project prototype that will never really become anything more Conclusion a gigantic DON'T BUY there are other options out there More so now that it has become a symbol of ignorance and malevolence P s if there are any Tesla competitors out there I'd be very willing to share a detailed report of the above They can't be selling all this smoke without consequences,1,2024-11-19
David Brown,I have a Tesla lease,I have a Tesla lease When I decided to move provinces I learn that the insurance company needs a form from Tesla Finance to be able to cancel the insurance in the first province I have been trying to get this from them for 2 months They won't respond so I'm stuck paying an extra 250 month in insurance because they won't provide a simple document No one will respond at all and there is no one to complain to The only people at Tesla you can contact are sales people to sell you a car When you need something after that you're on own Goodbye I'll never buy a Tesla again because of the company not the product,1,2024-11-07

Yazan Tk,Bad experience,I applied to purchase a Tesla in Houston Tx when I went to pick it up at the Cypress location I was shocked to find a front bumper damage on the car Despite multiple requests they neither replaced the car nor offered any compensation Later 300 was deducted as a reservation fee and 50 for insurance without prior notice After numerous attempts to communicate the response was entirely unhelpful This was a disappointing experience and I recommend thoroughly checking everything before purchasing from this location,1,2024-11-07

Karen Maher,Brent Cross collection point is a place,Brent Cross collection point is a place where youth and ambition come to die If anything goes wrong expect no one to take any responsibility or be remotely helpful in resolving issues Staff can barely make eye contact with you to begin with and when there was a mix up with trading in my current Tesla caused by their staff misinforming me I was treated with contempt rather than as a customer with any value In the follow up weeks where I repeatedly had to email a member of staff Louis Galvani who was meant to return my key cards to me I was simply ignored Aside from using the app getting in touch with a human to get anything done or raise a complaint is clearly made deliberately difficult and there is no desire to give good customer service despite the expense of a car to most people This seems to be their business model and if this is the future then count me out On the back of this experience my new Tesla will be my last and I ll switch to another electric car provider like BYD in the hope that they still value their customers,2,2024-10-17

SuperiorLux Property,Not worth the overall cost,The repair costs are not worth the purchase If at any point you need to deal with Tesla Service IN CT at least you will severely and thoroughly regret ever buying a Tesla The car itself is great but when it breaks it costs more than an entire used car Literally and anyone that disagrees I have the receipts to prove it The cars may be sexy fast efficient but overall all said and done pound for pound adding up all of the time you spend charging and repair costs my final answer is no not worth it I basically spent over 100 000 on what is essentially equivalent to a 20 000 value I do not recommend I would not recommend and I will NOT be purchasing another Tesla in the future I was under the impression that the longer a vehicle is in production the cheaper the parts would get I am wrong They go up,1,2024-10-14

Mette Olesen,Tesla has terrible customer service,I have had Teslas since they first came out I love the car BUT the business model has evolved over time into a very poor experience as a customer One month after I bought my last car they dropped the price twenty percent They also charged for the power cord and started charging for the use of super chargers The standard rims for the Model3 are terrible But worst of all they do not have customer service beyond an app interface If you value good customer service do not buy a TESLA,2,2024-07-01
Alessandro Pontes,It s been frustrating,I purchased a used certified pre owned vehicle from Tesla expecting a high standard of quality given the description that the car had undergone a thorough inspection Unfortunately the reality has been quite the opposite From the moment I took ownership I found myself performing the inspections identifying issues that should have been addressed beforehand Despite multiple attempts to resolve these problems with my local Tesla service center I am now scheduling my third visit in just three months On top of this the battery range has been another significant disappointment Tesla s commercial team presented me with a range far above what the vehicle actually delivers which is now showing only 75 of the promised total This has been a frustrating experience far from the quality and reliability Tesla claims to provide with their certified vehicles,1,2024-10-24
Qwerty,Tesla rubbish,If there was 0 star that would be appropriate Most overrated car ever thanks to free media publicity Tesla gets not sure to help boost their share price Yet reality is Tesla is nothing but rubbish in my honest opinion Thank God Chinese BYD and others have delivered some great electric cars I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla goes bankrupt in the next few years Do your research even the so called Cyber truck is the same I heard Door happens come off if you shut the door with force,1,2024-08-08
guardsman,Feel bitterly disappointed,Feel bitterly disappointed by the level of service from tesla I was emailed a delivery date for my new car After taking time off to recieve the delivery and waiting sometime I emailed the advisor to be told my car was reallocated and that car would not be delivered After I wrote to them again three times before even getting a reply This has ruined my thoughts on this car and I am extremely worried about the level of service I will recieve if I ever get the car,1,2024-09-04
K Smout,Appalling customer service,All the money you pay and you get treated like a mug We were frustrated enough that we needed to make a 140 mile round trip to pick up a car for an employee we've always had company cars delivered before but we didn't buy direct from Tesla before We had to place an order thro the website which isn't great to navigate then pre agreed a delivery date to align with existing car lease ending this itself a pain because you can only agree the date a few weeks before Then at the 11th hour Tesla and ALD their finance Co fail to communicate with each other and as a result the delivery day is changed We now have to take off more time change the insurance arrangements and that's before we get there and experience the 'light touch' handover which I've not heard good things about Never again will we buy a Tesla regretting this purchase before we've even got the car We're a small business and the whole process has been inflexible and cost us time and consequently money,1,2024-09-11
ENC,Hard rattle and squeak,Tesla Y experience after one year summarised Good Supercharger network Autopilot Ability to precondition cabin Integration with Apple Music Spotify etc Bad Constant rattles and squeaks that Tesla has tried but failed to fix and undermine otherwise silent driving Ridiculously hard suspension for UK roads The ride basically feels cheap If driving long holidays supercharger network still gives Tesla the edge If not higher quality softer rides exist,3,2024-06-10
D Rup,How can Tesla stay in business,We have a Tesla solar powerwall system Installation was a nightmare as their technician miss read his tool and thought Kg were lbs Ended up costing and much aggravation they denied it for months and then finally admitted it and fired the employee Now our system has been down for 4 months and the service call was just postponed another 2 months because the lost a service team Elon laid them off,1,2024-05-20
AntR,This company is going from bad to,This company is going from bad to worse I have been informed by Tesla customer service that their policy on allocating loaner vehicles has changed Considering most customers have between a 1 and 2 hour drive to the the nearest service centre then Tesla drivers could be in for some serious waiting times at your local centre I for one won't be staying with Tesla,1,2024-07-11
customer,What a total joke of a company,What a total joke of a company We put down a deposit for our car a brand new Model X Due to a hurricane the financing was delayed The dealership told us that if we didn't pick up our vehicle we would lose our deposit AND the car would be sold to someone else All we needed was a few more days for Navy Federal to finish the application which was never in doubt Instead to avoid losing the deposit and the car we went through Tesla finance at a higher interest rate and will re finance ASAP We think it was because it was the end of the quarter on top of it right after the APR through Tesla went down Furthermore we found defects in the car including a rattle and badly applied trim The Falcon doors promptly opened into the garage door tracks and scratched the paint since their sensors don't sense properly I can't get anyone to call me back from the dealership and I can't get in touch with the company BEWARE there are no live people to talk to Everything is a pre recorded message or handled through the app Worst ownership experience I've ever had in 35 years of purchasing vehicles Tesla clearly thinks that they are in such demand that they can get away mistreating people and that someone else will be along to take their place,1,2024-10-07
Antonio,Frustrating experience dealing with Tesla product support,My Tesla wall connector has developed a fault and would not charge my Tesla car anymore I thought it would be straight forward matter as the product was still under warranty I went on to the Tesla app and followed the instruction to try to get the matter resolved It was tedious but I was OK to go along Little did I know that I was about to embark on a nightmare journey There was little support rather I was asked to provide all kind of checking results There was a lot of back and forth by emails without knowing if there was a real person at the other end They asked for all the minor details even down to the complete wiring scheme of the wall connector I am not an electrician and the connector was installed by a Tesla recommended company I suggested Tesla to send someone out to inspect the connector themselves in order to confirm that the devise was truly faulty There was no reply no response complete radio silence This matter is still unresolved and I still can't use the wall connector It is quite an eye opener about how Tesla treats its customers,1,2024-09-26
Charles R,Worst service of any car company,I have a Model 3 It is without question the best car I've ever owned But then it needed service and Tesla's service system is SO AWFUL that it truly ruins the entire experience It's not just slow it how rudely customers are treated and how they hide behind a mask of technology It is impossible to speak to a human and their text messaging system usually just involves repeated canned answers They constantly reschedule try to blame me for not responding even at one point blamed me for rescheduling when it was their system Tesla how can you treat customers like this And how can you not have a person available to resolve matters when you buggy computer system fails,1,2024-07-19
Holly,Can't get ownership transferred,Can't get ownership on my Tesla transferred going on 5 weeks Previous owners transferred ownership and removed themselves Tried the app and there's a glitch and it won't complete because it says to connect the car to the internet which it is as indicated by the green check Told to wait 5 days just for an email took over a week Uploaded the required documents and told to wait another 5 days It's now past that and still nothing,1,2024-04-28
Mark,Tesla Model 3 2021,Tesla Model 3 2021 battery failed after 17900 miles still under warranty warning alert that max charge and range maybe reduced ok to drive book service soon Booked service request told wating for parts 1 month later still waiting for parts which turns out to be a new HV battery pack Max charge dropped to 70 then 39 and refusing to charge car unusable and been unable to use for work and need a car to get to the airport in 2 weeks Trying to sort a loan car from Tesla but no one cares no service or support Given run around through endless telephone menus Shocking Given the issues we've had with the 3 Tesla's the business purchased we won't be buying new Tesla's when the lease is up in a years' time unless they do something amazing to sort out this mess Shouldn't expect this after only 17k miles but apparently reading online a widespread problem,1,2024-06-28
Anthony Kenny,Customer service is an Oxymoron,Tried to contact their customer service multiple times for a Powerwall after 2 calls of over 1 hours on hold I gave up Customer service is non existent I'm sure I'm not the only one as well with over two thousand reviews and 73 being 1 star,1,2024-08-21
Kevin Houle,Service process and reschedules are horrible,First off the quality of this vehicle is way behind the Big Three in the US Delivered with hidden issues like a loose nut that rolls from side to side and a rip in the lower part of the dash that wasn't seen until a week in Scheduling service has been miserable appointments get rescheduled every time so far now from January 4 times out to July 8th This is horrible,1,2024-05-25
Farshad Khatabi,Mr Musk asking people for money like a,Mr Musk asking people for money like a begger by investing in her Plattform After I signed up to get information for investment I found out that his concentration is on investing in Crypto coins and oil companies which all are anti environment All of what he told about green energy new environmental solar panel and etc was a big lie His social credit is minus zero to me,1,2024-05-20
Duncan,I'll never use another Tesla product,I'll never use another Tesla product again in my life I've used Tesla Solar City solar panels on my home since late 2017 In mid 2024 my roof suffered extensive damage due to high winds and hail So I had Tesla remove my solar panels prior to the roof being repaired It cost 1 640 00 to have Tesla remove my solar panels I was informed that the cost of 1 640 00 was the total cost to have the solar panels removed and replaced But after my solar panels had been removed which was unavoidable only then was I informed that it would cost me 4 160 00 out of pocket to have the solar panels reinstalled on my roof I find that to be deeply dishonest It reminds me of what scam artists do Paying customers should be informed up front as to all costs incurred in a transaction Tesla did not inform me of the total cost until after my solar panels had been removed Tesla lost a customer For life By the way since I had the solar panels installed Solar City was bought out by Tesla the customer service phone number ceased to exist and all ALL communication with Tesla had to be done via an online chat through Tesla's website That meant you had to be stuck at your desk for upwards of half an hour while the Tesla employee took minutes to respond to each inquiry I typed in Now even the website online chat is gone and a customer has to download a Tesla app onto his or her phone just to communicate with someone at the company but still only via chat People use solar panels to save money Tesla apparently doesn t agree,1,2024-10-24
Steven R Davison,Tesla is the Best Car I've Owned,I'm 72 and I bought my first Tesla 18 months ago I absolutely love my Model 3 Performance Over the years I've had several high performance cars but this one is by far my favorite It's so much fun to drive and much more practical than all the other cars I've owned Love that I can charge it in my garage while I sleep at about one third the cost of gas Love that with over the air updates the car keeps improving Love that it can drive itself Etc etc etc My wife was meh when I bought the car but now she drives it whenever I don't need it and her car remains parked Tesla's are leading the car market into the future,5,2024-07-28
Roy Foo,Non existent support extremely long wait time,Very long wait time Service and customer support will give many reasons why the vehicle is normal and do not need repair Phone agent will get you to other departments to get you off the phone The support is basically non existent It is painful to get problems resolved,1,2024-07-12
Doug B,Service a China company on Amazon would be proud of,Our car has been in the Tesla shop for over a month and counting They do not communicate they do not have consistent answers on status when you drive there to get a response This company is brutal on customer service You could not provide a more incompetent and infuriating experience if you tried If i did not know better I would think i was on candid camera Please do not buy a Tesla if Elon knows the S is going on shame on him,1,2024-07-30
Niki Knopf,I will never buy another Tesla because,I will never buy another Tesla because they have the worst customer service I ve ever experienced After my car would not start and I called their roadside assistance to get to an operator they told me they could not help me and the best I could do is call 911 Every service agent treats you like a number You can only talk to them via an app They don t care Highly recommend buying a different car,1,2024-07-01
